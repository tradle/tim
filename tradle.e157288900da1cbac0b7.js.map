copyright</a>\\n\\n<a name=\\\"intro\\\"></a>\\nIntroduction\\n------------\\n\\n**[LevelDB](https://github.com/google/leveldb)** is a simple key/value data store built by Google, inspired by BigTable. It's used in Google Chrome and many other products. LevelDB supports arbitrary byte arrays as both keys and values, singular *get*, *put* and *delete* operations, *batched put and delete*, bi-directional iterators and simple compression using the very fast [Snappy](http://google.github.io/snappy/) algorithm.\\n\\n**LevelUP** aims to expose the features of LevelDB in a **Node.js-friendly way**. All standard `Buffer` encoding types are supported, as is a special JSON encoding. LevelDB's iterators are exposed as a Node.js-style **readable stream**.\\n\\nLevelDB stores entries **sorted lexicographically by keys**. This makes LevelUP's <a href=\\\"#createReadStream\\\"><code>ReadStream</code></a> interface a very powerful query mechanism.\\n\\n**LevelUP** is an **OPEN Open Source Project**, see the <a href=\\\"#contributing\\\">Contributing</a> section to find out what this means.\\n\\n<a name=\\\"leveldown\\\"></a>\\nRelationship to LevelDOWN\\n-------------------------\\n\\nLevelUP is designed to be backed by **[LevelDOWN](https://github.com/level/leveldown/)** which provides a pure C++ binding to LevelDB and can be used as a stand-alone package if required.\\n\\n**As of version 0.9, LevelUP no longer requires LevelDOWN as a dependency so you must `npm install leveldown` when you install LevelUP.**\\n\\nLevelDOWN is now optional because LevelUP can be used with alternative backends, such as **[level.js](https://github.com/maxogden/level.js)** in the browser or [MemDOWN](https://github.com/level/memdown) for a pure in-memory store.\\n\\nLevelUP will look for LevelDOWN and throw an error if it can't find it in its Node `require()` path. It will also tell you if the installed version of LevelDOWN is incompatible.\\n\\n**The [level](https://github.com/level/level) package is available as an alternative installation mechanism.** Install it instead to automatically get both LevelUP & LevelDOWN. It exposes LevelUP on its export (i.e. you can `var leveldb = require('level')`).\\n\\n\\n<a name=\\\"platforms\\\"></a>\\nTested & supported platforms\\n----------------------------\\n\\n  * **Linux**: including ARM platforms such as Raspberry Pi *and Kindle!*\\n  * **Mac OS**\\n  * **Solaris**: including Joyent's SmartOS & Nodejitsu\\n  * **Windows**: Node 0.10 and above only. See installation instructions for *node-gyp's* dependencies [here](https://github.com/TooTallNate/node-gyp#installation), you'll need these (free) components from Microsoft to compile and run any native Node add-on in Windows.\\n\\n<a name=\\\"basic\\\"></a>\\nBasic usage\\n-----------\\n\\nFirst you need to install LevelUP!\\n\\n```sh\\n$ npm install levelup leveldown\\n```\\n\\nOr\\n\\n```sh\\n$ npm install level\\n```\\n\\n*(this second option requires you to use LevelUP by calling `var levelup = require('level')`)*\\n\\n\\nAll operations are asynchronous although they don't necessarily require a callback if you don't need to know when the operation was performed.\\n\\n```js\\nvar levelup = require('levelup')\\n\\n// 1) Create our database, supply location and options.\\n//    This will create or open the underlying LevelDB store.\\nvar db = levelup('./mydb')\\n\\n// 2) put a key & value\\ndb.put('name', 'LevelUP', function (err) {\\n  if (err) return console.log('Ooops!', err) // some kind of I/O error\\n\\n  // 3) fetch by key\\n  db.get('name', function (err, value) {\\n    if (err) return console.log('Ooops!', err) // likely the key was not found\\n\\n    // ta da!\\n    console.log('name=' + value)\\n  })\\n})\\n```\\n\\n<a name=\\\"api\\\"></a>\\n## API\\n\\n  * <a href=\\\"#ctor\\\"><code><b>levelup()</b></code></a>\\n  * <a href=\\\"#open\\\"><code>db.<b>open()</b></code></a>\\n  * <a href=\\\"#close\\\"><code>db.<b>close()</b></code></a>\\n  * <a href=\\\"#put\\\"><code>db.<b>put()</b></code></a>\\n  * <a href=\\\"#get\\\"><code>db.<b>get()</b></code></a>\\n  * <a href=\\\"#del\\\"><code>db.<b>del()</b></code></a>\\n  * <a href=\\\"#batch\\\"><code>db.<b>batch()</b></code> *(array form)*</a>\\n  * <a href=\\\"#batch_chained\\\"><code>db.<b>batch()</b></code> *(chained form)*</a>\\n  * <a href=\\\"#isOpen\\\"><code>db.<b>isOpen()</b></code></a>\\n  * <a href=\\\"#isClosed\\\"><code>db.<b>isClosed()</b></code></a>\\n  * <a href=\\\"#createReadStream\\\"><code>db.<b>createReadStream()</b></code></a>\\n  * <a href=\\\"#createKeyStream\\\"><code>db.<b>createKeyStream()</b></code></a>\\n  * <a href=\\\"#createValueStream\\\"><code>db.<b>createValueStream()</b></code></a>\\n\\n### Special operations exposed by LevelDOWN\\n\\n  * <a href=\\\"#approximateSize\\\"><code>db.db.<b>approximateSize()</b></code></a>\\n  * <a href=\\\"#getProperty\\\"><code>db.db.<b>getProperty()</b></code></a>\\n  * <a href=\\\"#destroy\\\"><code><b>leveldown.destroy()</b></code></a>\\n  * <a href=\\\"#repair\\\"><code><b>leveldown.repair()</b></code></a>\\n\\n### Special Notes\\n  * <a href=\\\"#writeStreams\\\">What happened to <code><b>db.createWriteStream()</b></code></a>\\n\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------\\n<a name=\\\"ctor\\\"></a>\\n### levelup(location[, options[, callback]])\\n### levelup(options[, callback ])\\n### levelup(db[, callback ])\\n<code>levelup()</code> is the main entry point for creating a new LevelUP instance and opening the underlying store with LevelDB.\\n\\nThis function returns a new instance of LevelUP and will also initiate an <a href=\\\"#open\\\"><code>open()</code></a> operation. Opening the database is an asynchronous operation which will trigger your callback if you provide one. The callback should take the form: `function (err, db) {}` where the `db` is the LevelUP instance. If you don't provide a callback, any read & write operations are simply queued internally until the database is fully opened.\\n\\nThis leads to two alternative ways of managing a new LevelUP instance:\\n\\n```js\\nlevelup(location, options, function (err, db) {\\n  if (err) throw err\\n  db.get('foo', function (err, value) {\\n    if (err) return console.log('foo does not exist')\\n    console.log('got foo =', value)\\n  })\\n})\\n\\n// vs the equivalent:\\n\\nvar db = levelup(location, options) // will throw if an error occurs\\ndb.get('foo', function (err, value) {\\n  if (err) return console.log('foo does not exist')\\n  console.log('got foo =', value)\\n})\\n```\\n\\nThe `location` argument is available as a read-only property on the returned LevelUP instance.\\n\\nThe `levelup(options, callback)` form (with optional `callback`) is only available where you provide a valid `'db'` property on the options object (see below). Only for back-ends that don't require a `location` argument, such as [MemDOWN](https://github.com/level/memdown).\\n\\nFor example:\\n\\n```js\\nvar levelup = require('levelup')\\nvar memdown = require('memdown')\\nvar db = levelup({ db: memdown })\\n```\\n\\nThe `levelup(db, callback)` form (with optional `callback`) is only available where `db` is a factory function, as would be provided as a `'db'` property on an `options` object (see below). Only for back-ends that don't require a `location` argument, such as [MemDOWN](https://github.com/level/memdown).\\n\\nFor example:\\n\\n```js\\nvar levelup = require('levelup')\\nvar memdown = require('memdown')\\nvar db = levelup(memdown)\\n```\\n\\n#### `options`\\n\\n`levelup()` takes an optional options object as its second argument; the following properties are accepted:\\n\\n* `'createIfMissing'` *(boolean, default: `true`)*: If `true`, will initialise an empty database at the specified location if one doesn't already exist. If `false` and a database doesn't exist you will receive an error in your `open()` callback and your database won't open.\\n\\n* `'errorIfExists'` *(boolean, default: `false`)*: If `true`, you will receive an error in your `open()` callback if the database exists at the specified location.\\n\\n* `'compression'` *(boolean, default: `true`)*: If `true`, all *compressible* data will be run through the Snappy compression algorithm before being stored. Snappy is very fast and shouldn't gain much speed by disabling so leave this on unless you have good reason to turn it off.\\n\\n* `'cacheSize'` *(number, default: `8 * 1024 * 1024`)*: The size (in bytes) of the in-memory [LRU](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cache_algorithms#Least_Recently_Used) cache with frequently used uncompressed block contents.\\n\\n* `'keyEncoding'` and `'valueEncoding'` *(string, default: `'utf8'`)*: The encoding of the keys and values passed through Node.js' `Buffer` implementation (see [Buffer#toString()](http://nodejs.org/docs/latest/api/buffer.html#buffer_buf_tostring_encoding_start_end)).\\n  <p><code>'utf8'</code> is the default encoding for both keys and values so you can simply pass in strings and expect strings from your <code>get()</code> operations. You can also pass <code>Buffer</code> objects as keys and/or values and conversion will be performed.</p>\\n  <p>Supported encodings are: hex, utf8, ascii, binary, base64, ucs2, utf16le.</p>\\n  <p><code>'json'</code> encoding is also supported, see below.</p>\\n\\n* `'db'` *(object, default: LevelDOWN)*: LevelUP is backed by [LevelDOWN](https://github.com/level/leveldown/) to provide an interface to LevelDB. You can completely replace the use of LevelDOWN by providing a \\\"factory\\\" function that will return a LevelDOWN API compatible object given a `location` argument. For further information, see [MemDOWN](https://github.com/level/memdown), a fully LevelDOWN API compatible replacement that uses a memory store rather than LevelDB. Also see [Abstract LevelDOWN](http://github.com/level/abstract-leveldown), a partial implementation of the LevelDOWN API that can be used as a base prototype for a LevelDOWN substitute.\\n\\nAdditionally, each of the main interface methods accept an optional options object that can be used to override `'keyEncoding'` and `'valueEncoding'`.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------\\n<a name=\\\"open\\\"></a>\\n### db.open([callback])\\n<code>open()</code> opens the underlying LevelDB store. In general **you should never need to call this method directly** as it's automatically called by <a href=\\\"#ctor\\\"><code>levelup()</code></a>.\\n\\nHowever, it is possible to *reopen* a database after it has been closed with <a href=\\\"#close\\\"><code>close()</code></a>, although this is not generally advised.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------\\n<a name=\\\"close\\\"></a>\\n### db.close([callback])\\n<code>close()</code> closes the underlying LevelDB store. The callback will receive any error encountered during closing as the first argument.\\n\\nYou should always clean up your LevelUP instance by calling `close()` when you no longer need it to free up resources. A LevelDB store cannot be opened by multiple instances of LevelDB/LevelUP simultaneously.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------\\n<a name=\\\"put\\\"></a>\\n### db.put(key, value[, options][, callback])\\n<code>put()</code> is the primary method for inserting data into the store. Both the `key` and `value` can be arbitrary data objects.\\n\\nThe callback argument is optional but if you don't provide one and an error occurs then expect the error to be thrown.\\n\\n#### `options`\\n\\nEncoding of the `key` and `value` objects will adhere to `'keyEncoding'` and `'valueEncoding'` options provided to <a href=\\\"#ctor\\\"><code>levelup()</code></a>, although you can provide alternative encoding settings in the options for `put()` (it's recommended that you stay consistent in your encoding of keys and values in a single store).\\n\\nIf you provide a `'sync'` value of `true` in your `options` object, LevelDB will perform a synchronous write of the data; although the operation will be asynchronous as far as Node is concerned. Normally, LevelDB passes the data to the operating system for writing and returns immediately, however a synchronous write will use `fsync()` or equivalent so your callback won't be triggered until the data is actually on disk. Synchronous filesystem writes are **significantly** slower than asynchronous writes but if you want to be absolutely sure that the data is flushed then you can use `'sync': true`.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------\\n<a name=\\\"get\\\"></a>\\n### db.get(key[, options][, callback])\\n<code>get()</code> is the primary method for fetching data from the store. The `key` can be an arbitrary data object. If it doesn't exist in the store then the callback will receive an error as its first argument. A not-found err object will be of type `'NotFoundError'` so you can `err.type == 'NotFoundError'` or you can perform a truthy test on the property `err.notFound`.\\n\\n```js\\ndb.get('foo', function (err, value) {\\n  if (err) {\\n    if (err.notFound) {\\n      // handle a 'NotFoundError' here\\n      return\\n    }\\n    // I/O or other error, pass it up the callback chain\\n    return callback(err)\\n  }\\n\\n  // .. handle `value` here\\n})\\n```\\n\\n#### `options`\\n\\nEncoding of the `key` and `value` objects is the same as in <a href=\\\"#put\\\"><code>put</code></a>. \\n\\nLevelDB will by default fill the in-memory LRU Cache with data from a call to get. Disabling this is done by setting `fillCache` to `false`.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------\\n<a name=\\\"del\\\"></a>\\n### db.del(key[, options][, callback])\\n<code>del()</code> is the primary method for removing data from the store.\\n```js\\ndb.del('foo', function (err) {\\n  if (err)\\n    // handle I/O or other error\\n});\\n```\\n\\n#### `options`\\n\\nEncoding of the `key` object will adhere to the `'keyEncoding'` option provided to <a href=\\\"#ctor\\\"><code>levelup()</code></a>, although you can provide alternative encoding settings in the options for `del()` (it's recommended that you stay consistent in your encoding of keys and values in a single store).\\n\\nA `'sync'` option can also be passed, see <a href=\\\"#put\\\"><code>put()</code></a> for details on how this works.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------\\n<a name=\\\"batch\\\"></a>\\n### db.batch(array[, options][, callback]) *(array form)*\\n<code>batch()</code> can be used for very fast bulk-write operations (both *put* and *delete*). The `array` argument should contain a list of operations to be executed sequentially, although as a whole they are performed as an atomic operation inside LevelDB.\\n\\nEach operation is contained in an object having the following properties: `type`, `key`, `value`, where the *type* is either `'put'` or `'del'`. In the case of `'del'` the `'value'` property is ignored. Any entries with a `'key'` of `null` or `undefined` will cause an error to be returned on the `callback` and any `'type': 'put'` entry with a `'value'` of `null` or `undefined` will return an error.\\n\\nIf `key` and `value` are defined but `type` is not, it will default to `'put'`.\\n\\n```js\\nvar ops = [\\n    { type: 'del', key: 'father' }\\n  , { type: 'put', key: 'name', value: 'Yuri Irsenovich Kim' }\\n  , { type: 'put', key: 'dob', value: '16 February 1941' }\\n  , { type: 'put', key: 'spouse', value: 'Kim Young-sook' }\\n  , { type: 'put', key: 'occupation', value: 'Clown' }\\n]\\n\\ndb.batch(ops, function (err) {\\n  if (err) return console.log('Ooops!', err)\\n  console.log('Great success dear leader!')\\n})\\n```\\n\\n#### `options`\\n\\nSee <a href=\\\"#put\\\"><code>put()</code></a> for a discussion on the `options` object. You can overwrite default `'keyEncoding'` and `'valueEncoding'` and also specify the use of `sync` filesystem operations.\\n\\nIn addition to encoding options for the whole batch you can also overwrite the encoding per operation, like:\\n\\n```js\\nvar ops = [{\\n    type          : 'put'\\n  , key           : new Buffer([1, 2, 3])\\n  , value         : { some: 'json' }\\n  , keyEncoding   : 'binary'\\n  , valueEncoding : 'json'\\n}]\\n```\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------\\n<a name=\\\"batch_chained\\\"></a>\\n### db.batch() *(chained form)*\\n<code>batch()</code>, when called with no arguments will return a `Batch` object which can be used to build, and eventually commit, an atomic LevelDB batch operation. Depending on how it's used, it is possible to obtain greater performance when using the chained form of `batch()` over the array form.\\n\\n```js\\ndb.batch()\\n  .del('father')\\n  .put('name', 'Yuri Irsenovich Kim')\\n  .put('dob', '16 February 1941')\\n  .put('spouse', 'Kim Young-sook')\\n  .put('occupation', 'Clown')\\n  .write(function () { console.log('Done!') })\\n```\\n\\n<b><code>batch.put(key, value[, options])</code></b>\\n\\nQueue a *put* operation on the current batch, not committed until a `write()` is called on the batch.\\n\\nThe optional `options` argument can be used to override the default `'keyEncoding'` and/or `'valueEncoding'`.\\n\\nThis method may `throw` a `WriteError` if there is a problem with your put (such as the `value` being `null` or `undefined`).\\n\\n<b><code>batch.del(key[, options])</code></b>\\n\\nQueue a *del* operation on the current batch, not committed until a `write()` is called on the batch.\\n\\nThe optional `options` argument can be used to override the default `'keyEncoding'`.\\n\\nThis method may `throw` a `WriteError` if there is a problem with your delete.\\n\\n<b><code>batch.clear()</code></b>\\n\\nClear all queued operations on the current batch, any previous operations will be discarded.\\n\\n<b><code>batch.length</code></b>\\n\\nThe number of queued operations on the current batch.\\n\\n<b><code>batch.write([callback])</code></b>\\n\\nCommit the queued operations for this batch. All operations not *cleared* will be written to the database atomically, that is, they will either all succeed or fail with no partial commits. The optional `callback` will be called when the operation has completed with an *error* argument if an error has occurred; if no `callback` is supplied and an error occurs then this method will `throw` a `WriteError`.\\n\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------\\n<a name=\\\"isOpen\\\"></a>\\n### db.isOpen()\\n\\nA LevelUP object can be in one of the following states:\\n\\n  * *\\\"new\\\"*     - newly created, not opened or closed\\n  * *\\\"opening\\\"* - waiting for the database to be opened\\n  * *\\\"open\\\"*    - successfully opened the database, available for use\\n  * *\\\"closing\\\"* - waiting for the database to be closed\\n  * *\\\"closed\\\"*  - database has been successfully closed, should not be used\\n\\n`isOpen()` will return `true` only when the state is \\\"open\\\".\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------\\n<a name=\\\"isClosed\\\"></a>\\n### db.isClosed()\\n\\n*See <a href=\\\"#put\\\"><code>isOpen()</code></a>*\\n\\n`isClosed()` will return `true` only when the state is \\\"closing\\\" *or* \\\"closed\\\", it can be useful for determining if read and write operations are permissible.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------\\n<a name=\\\"createReadStream\\\"></a>\\n### db.createReadStream([options])\\n\\nYou can obtain a **ReadStream** of the full database by calling the `createReadStream()` method. The resulting stream is a complete Node.js-style [Readable Stream](http://nodejs.org/docs/latest/api/stream.html#stream_readable_stream) where `'data'` events emit objects with `'key'` and `'value'` pairs. You can also use the `gt`, `lt` and `limit` options to control the range of keys that are streamed.\\n\\n```js\\ndb.createReadStream()\\n  .on('data', function (data) {\\n    console.log(data.key, '=', data.value)\\n  })\\n  .on('error', function (err) {\\n    console.log('Oh my!', err)\\n  })\\n  .on('close', function () {\\n    console.log('Stream closed')\\n  })\\n  .on('end', function () {\\n    console.log('Stream closed')\\n  })\\n```\\n\\nThe standard `pause()`, `resume()` and `destroy()` methods are implemented on the ReadStream, as is `pipe()` (see below). `'data'`, '`error'`, `'end'` and `'close'` events are emitted.\\n\\nAdditionally, you can supply an options object as the first parameter to `createReadStream()` with the following options:\\n\\n* `'gt'` (greater than), `'gte'` (greater than or equal) define the lower bound of the range to be streamed. Only records where the key is greater than (or equal to) this option will be included in the range. When `reverse=true` the order will be reversed, but the records streamed will be the same.\\n\\n* `'lt'` (less than), `'lte'` (less than or equal) define the higher bound of the range to be streamed. Only key/value pairs where the key is less than (or equal to) this option will be included in the range. When `reverse=true` the order will be reversed, but the records streamed will be the same.\\n\\n* `'start', 'end'` legacy ranges - instead use `'gte', 'lte'`\\n\\n* `'reverse'` *(boolean, default: `false`)*: a boolean, set true and the stream output will be reversed. Beware that due to the way LevelDB works, a reverse seek will be slower than a forward seek.\\n\\n* `'keys'` *(boolean, default: `true`)*: whether the `'data'` event should contain keys. If set to `true` and `'values'` set to `false` then `'data'` events will simply be keys, rather than objects with a `'key'` property. Used internally by the `createKeyStream()` method.\\n\\n* `'values'` *(boolean, default: `true`)*: whether the `'data'` event should contain values. If set to `true` and `'keys'` set to `false` then `'data'` events will simply be values, rather than objects with a `'value'` property. Used internally by the `createValueStream()` method.\\n\\n* `'limit'` *(number, default: `-1`)*: limit the number of results collected by this stream. This number represents a *maximum* number of results and may not be reached if you get to the end of the data first. A value of `-1` means there is no limit. When `reverse=true` the highest keys will be returned instead of the lowest keys.\\n\\n* `'fillCache'` *(boolean, default: `false`)*: whether LevelDB's LRU-cache should be filled with data read.\\n\\n* `'keyEncoding'` / `'valueEncoding'` *(string)*: the encoding applied to each read piece of data.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------\\n<a name=\\\"createKeyStream\\\"></a>\\n### db.createKeyStream([options])\\n\\nA **KeyStream** is a **ReadStream** where the `'data'` events are simply the keys from the database so it can be used like a traditional stream rather than an object stream.\\n\\nYou can obtain a KeyStream either by calling the `createKeyStream()` method on a LevelUP object or by passing an options object to `createReadStream()` with `keys` set to `true` and `values` set to `false`.\\n\\n```js\\ndb.createKeyStream()\\n  .on('data', function (data) {\\n    console.log('key=', data)\\n  })\\n\\n// same as:\\ndb.createReadStream({ keys: true, values: false })\\n  .on('data', function (data) {\\n    console.log('key=', data)\\n  })\\n```\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------\\n<a name=\\\"createValueStream\\\"></a>\\n### db.createValueStream([options])\\n\\nA **ValueStream** is a **ReadStream** where the `'data'` events are simply the values from the database so it can be used like a traditional stream rather than an object stream.\\n\\nYou can obtain a ValueStream either by calling the `createValueStream()` method on a LevelUP object or by passing an options object to `createReadStream()` with `values` set to `true` and `keys` set to `false`.\\n\\n```js\\ndb.createValueStream()\\n  .on('data', function (data) {\\n    console.log('value=', data)\\n  })\\n\\n// same as:\\ndb.createReadStream({ keys: false, values: true })\\n  .on('data', function (data) {\\n    console.log('value=', data)\\n  })\\n```\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------\\n<a name=\\\"writeStreams\\\"></a>\\n#### What happened to `db.createWriteStream`?\\n\\n`db.createWriteStream()` has been removed in order to provide a smaller and more maintainable core. It primarily existed to create symmetry with `db.createReadStream()` but through much [discussion](https://github.com/level/levelup/issues/199), removing it was the best cause of action.\\n\\nThe main driver for this was performance. While `db.createReadStream()` performs well under most use cases, `db.createWriteStream()` was highly dependent on the application keys and values. Thus we can't provide a standard implementation and encourage more `write-stream` implementations to be created to solve the broad spectrum of use cases.\\n\\nCheck out the implementations that the community has already produced [here](https://github.com/level/levelup/wiki/Modules#write-streams).\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------\\n<a name='approximateSize'></a>\\n### db.db.approximateSize(start, end, callback)\\n<code>approximateSize()</code> can used to get the approximate number of bytes of file system space used by the range `[start..end)`. The result may not include recently written data.\\n\\n```js\\nvar db = require('level')('./huge.db')\\n\\ndb.db.approximateSize('a', 'c', function (err, size) {\\n  if (err) return console.error('Ooops!', err)\\n  console.log('Approximate size of range is %d', size)\\n})\\n```\\n\\n**Note:** `approximateSize()` is available via [LevelDOWN](https://github.com/level/leveldown/), which by default is accessible as the `db` property of your LevelUP instance. This is a specific LevelDB operation and is not likely to be available where you replace LevelDOWN with an alternative back-end via the `'db'` option.\\n\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------\\n<a name='getProperty'></a>\\n### db.db.getProperty(property)\\n<code>getProperty</code> can be used to get internal details from LevelDB. When issued with a valid property string, a readable string will be returned (this method is synchronous).\\n\\nCurrently, the only valid properties are:\\n\\n* <b><code>'leveldb.num-files-at-levelN'</code></b>: returns the number of files at level *N*, where N is an integer representing a valid level (e.g. \\\"0\\\").\\n\\n* <b><code>'leveldb.stats'</code></b>: returns a multi-line string describing statistics about LevelDB's internal operation.\\n\\n* <b><code>'leveldb.sstables'</code></b>: returns a multi-line string describing all of the *sstables* that make up contents of the current database.\\n\\n\\n```js\\nvar db = require('level')('./huge.db')\\nconsole.log(db.db.getProperty('leveldb.num-files-at-level3'))\\n// → '243'\\n```\\n\\n**Note:** `getProperty()` is available via [LevelDOWN](https://github.com/level/leveldown/), which by default is accessible as the `db` property of your LevelUP instance. This is a specific LevelDB operation and is not likely to be available where you replace LevelDOWN with an alternative back-end via the `'db'` option.\\n\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------\\n<a name=\\\"destroy\\\"></a>\\n### leveldown.destroy(location, callback)\\n<code>destroy()</code> is used to completely remove an existing LevelDB database directory. You can use this function in place of a full directory *rm* if you want to be sure to only remove LevelDB-related files. If the directory only contains LevelDB files, the directory itself will be removed as well. If there are additional, non-LevelDB files in the directory, those files, and the directory, will be left alone.\\n\\nThe callback will be called when the destroy operation is complete, with a possible `error` argument.\\n\\n**Note:** `destroy()` is available via [LevelDOWN](https://github.com/level/leveldown/) which you will have to install seperately, e.g.:\\n\\n```js\\nrequire('leveldown').destroy('./huge.db', function (err) { console.log('done!') })\\n```\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------\\n<a name=\\\"repair\\\"></a>\\n### leveldown.repair(location, callback)\\n<code>repair()</code> can be used to attempt a restoration of a damaged LevelDB store. From the LevelDB documentation:\\n\\n> If a DB cannot be opened, you may attempt to call this method to resurrect as much of the contents of the database as possible. Some data may be lost, so be careful when calling this function on a database that contains important information.\\n\\nYou will find information on the *repair* operation in the *LOG* file inside the store directory.\\n\\nA `repair()` can also be used to perform a compaction of the LevelDB log into table files.\\n\\nThe callback will be called when the repair operation is complete, with a possible `error` argument.\\n\\n**Note:** `repair()` is available via [LevelDOWN](https://github.com/level/leveldown/) which you will have to install seperately, e.g.:\\n\\n```js\\nrequire('leveldown').repair('./huge.db', function (err) { console.log('done!') })\\n```\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n<a name=\\\"events\\\"></a>\\nEvents\\n------\\n\\nLevelUP emits events when the callbacks to the corresponding methods are called.\\n\\n* `db.emit('put', key, value)` emitted when a new value is `'put'`\\n* `db.emit('del', key)` emitted when a value is deleted\\n* `db.emit('batch', ary)` emitted when a batch operation has executed\\n* `db.emit('ready')` emitted when the database has opened (`'open'` is synonym)\\n* `db.emit('closed')` emitted when the database has closed\\n* `db.emit('opening')` emitted when the database is opening\\n* `db.emit('closing')` emitted when the database is closing\\n\\nIf you do not pass a callback to an async function, and there is an error, LevelUP will `emit('error', err)` instead.\\n\\n<a name=\\\"json\\\"></a>\\nJSON data\\n---------\\n\\nYou specify `'json'` encoding for both keys and/or values, you can then supply JavaScript objects to LevelUP and receive them from all fetch operations, including ReadStreams. LevelUP will automatically *stringify* your objects and store them as *utf8* and parse the strings back into objects before passing them back to you.\\n\\n<a name=\\\"custom_encodings\\\"></a>\\nCustom encodings\\n----------------\\n\\nA custom encoding may be provided by passing in an object as an value for `keyEncoding` or `valueEncoding` (wherever accepted), it must have the following properties:\\n\\n```js\\n{\\n    encode : function (val) { ... }\\n  , decode : function (val) { ... }\\n  , buffer : boolean // encode returns a buffer and decode accepts a buffer\\n  , type   : String  // name of this encoding type.\\n}\\n```\\n\\n<a name=\\\"extending\\\"></a>\\nExtending LevelUP\\n-----------------\\n\\nA list of <a href=\\\"https://github.com/level/levelup/wiki/Modules\\\"><b>Node.js LevelDB modules and projects</b></a> can be found in the wiki.\\n\\nWhen attempting to extend the functionality of LevelUP, it is recommended that you consider using [level-hooks](https://github.com/dominictarr/level-hooks) and/or [level-sublevel](https://github.com/dominictarr/level-sublevel). **level-sublevel** is particularly helpful for keeping additional, extension-specific, data in a LevelDB store. It allows you to partition a LevelUP instance into multiple sub-instances that each correspond to discrete namespaced key ranges.\\n\\n<a name=\\\"multiproc\\\"></a>\\nMulti-process access\\n--------------------\\n\\nLevelDB is thread-safe but is **not** suitable for accessing with multiple processes. You should only ever have a LevelDB database open from a single Node.js process. Node.js clusters are made up of multiple processes so a LevelUP instance cannot be shared between them either.\\n\\nSee the <a href=\\\"https://github.com/level/levelup/wiki/Modules\\\"><b>wiki</b></a> for some LevelUP extensions, including [multilevel](https://github.com/juliangruber/multilevel), that may help if you require a single data store to be shared across processes.\\n\\n<a name=\\\"support\\\"></a>\\nGetting support\\n---------------\\n\\nThere are multiple ways you can find help in using LevelDB in Node.js:\\n\\n * **IRC:** you'll find an active group of LevelUP users in the **##leveldb** channel on Freenode, including most of the contributors to this project.\\n * **Mailing list:** there is an active [Node.js LevelDB](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/node-levelup) Google Group.\\n * **GitHub:** you're welcome to open an issue here on this GitHub repository if you have a question.\\n\\n<a name=\\\"contributing\\\"></a>\\nContributing\\n------------\\n\\nLevelUP is an **OPEN Open Source Project**. This means that:\\n\\n> Individuals making significant and valuable contributions are given commit-access to the project to contribute as they see fit. This project is more like an open wiki than a standard guarded open source project.\\n\\nSee the [contribution guide](https://github.com/Level/community/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) for more details.\\n\\n### Windows\\n\\nA large portion of the Windows support comes from code by [Krzysztof Kowalczyk](http://blog.kowalczyk.info/) [@kjk](https://twitter.com/kjk), see his Windows LevelDB port [here](http://code.google.com/r/kkowalczyk-leveldb/).

Sometimes it's called a \"filter\",\n\t// but that's not a great name for it, since that implies a thing where\n\t// some bits pass through, and others are simply ignored.  (That would\n\t// be a valid example of a transform, of course.)\n\t//\n\t// While the output is causally related to the input, it's not a\n\t// necessarily symmetric or synchronous transformation.  For example,\n\t// a zlib stream might take multiple plain-text writes(), and then\n\t// emit a single compressed chunk some time in the future.\n\t//\n\t// Here's how this works:\n\t//\n\t// The Transform stream has all the aspects of the readable and writable\n\t// stream classes.  When you write(chunk), that calls _write(chunk,cb)\n\t// internally, and returns false if there's a lot of pending writes\n\t// buffered up.  When you call read(), that calls _read(n) until\n\t// there's enough pending readable data buffered up.\n\t//\n\t// In a transform stream, the written data is placed in a buffer.  When\n\t// _read(n) is called, it transforms the queued up data, calling the\n\t// buffered _write cb's as it consumes chunks.  If consuming a single\n\t// written chunk would result in multiple output chunks, then the first\n\t// outputted bit calls the readcb, and subsequent chunks just go into\n\t// the read buffer, and will cause it to emit 'readable' if necessary.\n\t//\n\t// This way, back-pressure is actually determined by the reading side,\n\t// since _read has to be called to start processing a new chunk.  However,\n\t// a pathological inflate type of transform can cause excessive buffering\n\t// here.  For example, imagine a stream where every byte of input is\n\t// interpreted as an integer from 0-255, and then results in that many\n\t// bytes of output.  Writing the 4 bytes {ff,ff,ff,ff} would result in\n\t// 1kb of data being output.  In this case, you could write a very small\n\t// amount of input, and end up with a very large amount of output.  In\n\t// such a pathological inflating mechanism, there'd be no way to tell\n\t// the system to stop doing the transform.  A single 4MB write could\n\t// cause the system to run out of memory.\n\t//\n\t// However, even in such a pathological case, only a single written chunk\n\t// would be consumed, and then the rest would wait (un-transformed) until\n\t// the results of the previous transformed chunk were consumed.\n\t\n\tmodule.exports = Transform;\n\t\n\tvar Duplex = __webpack_require__(1345);\n\t\n\t/*<replacement>*/\n\tvar util = __webpack_require__(830);\n\tutil.inherits = __webpack_require__(812);\n\t/*</replacement>*/\n\t\n\tutil.inherits(Transform, Duplex);\n\t\n\tfunction TransformState(options, stream) {\n\t  this.afterTransform = function (er, data) {\n\t    return afterTransform(stream, er, data);\n\t  };\n\t\n\t  this.needTransform = false;\n\t  this.transforming = false;\n\t  this.writecb = null;\n\t  this.writechunk = null;\n\t}\n\t\n\tfunction afterTransform(stream, er, data) {\n\t  var ts = stream._transformState;\n\t  ts.transforming = false;\n\t\n\t  var cb = ts.writecb;\n\t\n\t  if (!cb) return stream.emit('error', new Error('no writecb in Transform class'));\n\t\n\t  ts.writechunk = null;\n\t  ts.writecb = null;\n\t\n\t  if (data !== null && data !== undefined) stream.push(data);\n\t\n\t  if (cb) cb(er);\n\t\n\t  var rs = stream._readableState;\n\t  rs.reading = false;\n\t  if (rs.needReadable || rs.length < rs.highWaterMark) {\n\t    stream._read(rs.highWaterMark);\n\t  }\n\t}\n\t\n\tfunction Transform(options) {\n\t  if (!(this instanceof Transform)) return new Transform(options);\n\t\n\t  Duplex.call(this, options);\n\t\n\t  var ts = this._transformState = new TransformState(options, this);\n\t\n\t  // when the writable side finishes, then flush out anything remaining.\n\t  var stream = this;\n\t\n\t  // start out asking for a readable event once data is transformed.\n\t  this._readableState.needReadable = true;\n\t\n\t  // we have implemented the _read method, and done the other things\n\t  // that Readable wants before the first _read call, so unset the\n\t  // sync guard flag.\n\t  this._readableState.sync = false;\n\t\n\t  this.once('finish', function () {\n\t    if ('function' === typeof this._flush) this._flush(function (er) {\n\t      done(stream, er);\n\t    });else done(stream);\n\t  });\n\t}\n\t\n\tTransform.prototype.push = function (chunk, encoding) {\n\t  this._transformState.needTransform = false;\n\t  return Duplex.prototype.push.call(this, chunk, encoding);\n\t};\n\t\n\t// This is the part where you do stuff!\n\t// override this function in implementation classes.\n\t// 'chunk' is an input chunk.\n\t//\n\t// Call `push(newChunk)` to pass along transformed output\n\t// to the readable side.

Sometimes it's called a \"filter\",\n\t// but that's not a great name for it, since that implies a thing where\n\t// some bits pass through, and others are simply ignored.  (That would\n\t// be a valid example of a transform, of course.)\n\t//\n\t// While the output is causally related to the input, it's not a\n\t// necessarily symmetric or synchronous transformation.  For example,\n\t// a zlib stream might take multiple plain-text writes(), and then\n\t// emit a single compressed chunk some time in the future.\n\t//\n\t// Here's how this works:\n\t//\n\t// The Transform stream has all the aspects of the readable and writable\n\t// stream classes.  When you write(chunk), that calls _write(chunk,cb)\n\t// internally, and returns false if there's a lot of pending writes\n\t// buffered up.  When you call read(), that calls _read(n) until\n\t// there's enough pending readable data buffered up.\n\t//\n\t// In a transform stream, the written data is placed in a buffer.  When\n\t// _read(n) is called, it transforms the queued up data, calling the\n\t// buffered _write cb's as it consumes chunks.  If consuming a single\n\t// written chunk would result in multiple output chunks, then the first\n\t// outputted bit calls the readcb, and subsequent chunks just go into\n\t// the read buffer, and will cause it to emit 'readable' if necessary.\n\t//\n\t// This way, back-pressure is actually determined by the reading side,\n\t// since _read has to be called to start processing a new chunk.  However,\n\t// a pathological inflate type of transform can cause excessive buffering\n\t// here.  For example, imagine a stream where every byte of input is\n\t// interpreted as an integer from 0-255, and then results in that many\n\t// bytes of output.  Writing the 4 bytes {ff,ff,ff,ff} would result in\n\t// 1kb of data being output.  In this case, you could write a very small\n\t// amount of input, and end up with a very large amount of output.  In\n\t// such a pathological inflating mechanism, there'd be no way to tell\n\t// the system to stop doing the transform.  A single 4MB write could\n\t// cause the system to run out of memory.\n\t//\n\t// However, even in such a pathological case, only a single written chunk\n\t// would be consumed, and then the rest would wait (un-transformed) until\n\t// the results of the previous transformed chunk were consumed.\n\t\n\t'use strict';\n\t\n\tmodule.exports = Transform;\n\t\n\tvar Duplex = __webpack_require__(1877);\n\t\n\t/*<replacement>*/\n\tvar util = __webpack_require__(830);\n\tutil.inherits = __webpack_require__(812);\n\t/*</replacement>*/\n\t\n\tutil.inherits(Transform, Duplex);\n\t\n\tfunction TransformState(stream) {\n\t  this.afterTransform = function (er, data) {\n\t    return afterTransform(stream, er, data);\n\t  };\n\t\n\t  this.needTransform = false;\n\t  this.transforming = false;\n\t  this.writecb = null;\n\t  this.writechunk = null;\n\t  this.writeencoding = null;\n\t}\n\t\n\tfunction afterTransform(stream, er, data) {\n\t  var ts = stream._transformState;\n\t  ts.transforming = false;\n\t\n\t  var cb = ts.writecb;\n\t\n\t  if (!cb) return stream.emit('error', new Error('no writecb in Transform class'));\n\t\n\t  ts.writechunk = null;\n\t  ts.writecb = null;\n\t\n\t  if (data !== null && data !== undefined) stream.push(data);\n\t\n\t  cb(er);\n\t\n\t  var rs = stream._readableState;\n\t  rs.reading = false;\n\t  if (rs.needReadable || rs.length < rs.highWaterMark) {\n\t    stream._read(rs.highWaterMark);\n\t  }\n\t}\n\t\n\tfunction Transform(options) {\n\t  if (!(this instanceof Transform)) return new Transform(options);\n\t\n\t  Duplex.call(this, options);\n\t\n\t  this._transformState = new TransformState(this);\n\t\n\t  // when the writable side finishes, then flush out anything remaining.\n\t  var stream = this;\n\t\n\t  // start out asking for a readable event once data is transformed.\n\t  this._readableState.needReadable = true;\n\t\n\t  // we have implemented the _read method, and done the other things\n\t  // that Readable wants before the first _read call, so unset the\n\t  // sync guard flag.\n\t  this._readableState.sync = false;\n\t\n\t  if (options) {\n\t    if (typeof options.transform === 'function') this._transform = options.transform;\n\t\n\t    if (typeof options.flush === 'function') this._flush = options.flush;\n\t  }\n\t\n\t  this.once('prefinish', function () {\n\t    if (typeof this._flush === 'function') this._flush(function (er) {\n\t      done(stream, er);\n\t    });else done(stream);\n\t  });\n\t}\n\t\n\tTransform.prototype.push = function (chunk, encoding) {\n\t  this._transformState.needTransform = false;\n\t  return Duplex.prototype.push.call(this, chunk, encoding);\n\t};\n\t\n\t// This is the part where you do stuff!\n\t// override this function in implementation classes.\n\t// 'chunk' is an input chunk.\n\t//\n\t// Call `push(newChunk)` to pass along transformed output\n\t// to the readable side.

copyright</a>\\n\\n<a name=\\\"intro\\\"></a>\\nIntroduction\\n------------\\n\\n**[LevelDB](https://github.com/google/leveldb)** is a simple key/value data store built by Google, inspired by BigTable. It's used in Google Chrome and many other products. LevelDB supports arbitrary byte arrays as both keys and values, singular *get*, *put* and *delete* operations, *batched put and delete*, bi-directional iterators and simple compression using the very fast [Snappy](http://google.github.io/snappy/) algorithm.\\n\\n**LevelUP** aims to expose the features of LevelDB in a **Node.js-friendly way**. All standard `Buffer` encoding types are supported, as is a special JSON encoding. LevelDB's iterators are exposed as a Node.js-style **readable stream**.\\n\\nLevelDB stores entries **sorted lexicographically by keys**. This makes LevelUP's <a href=\\\"#createReadStream\\\"><code>ReadStream</code></a> interface a very powerful query mechanism.\\n\\n**LevelUP** is an **OPEN Open Source Project**, see the <a href=\\\"#contributing\\\">Contributing</a> section to find out what this means.\\n\\n<a name=\\\"leveldown\\\"></a>\\nRelationship to LevelDOWN\\n-------------------------\\n\\nLevelUP is designed to be backed by **[LevelDOWN](https://github.com/level/leveldown/)** which provides a pure C++ binding to LevelDB and can be used as a stand-alone package if required.\\n\\n**As of version 0.9, LevelUP no longer requires LevelDOWN as a dependency so you must `npm install leveldown` when you install LevelUP.**\\n\\nLevelDOWN is now optional because LevelUP can be used with alternative backends, such as **[level.js](https://github.com/maxogden/level.js)** in the browser or [MemDOWN](https://github.com/level/memdown) for a pure in-memory store.\\n\\nLevelUP will look for LevelDOWN and throw an error if it can't find it in its Node `require()` path. It will also tell you if the installed version of LevelDOWN is incompatible.\\n\\n**The [level](https://github.com/level/level) package is available as an alternative installation mechanism.** Install it instead to automatically get both LevelUP & LevelDOWN. It exposes LevelUP on its export (i.e. you can `var leveldb = require('level')`).\\n\\n\\n<a name=\\\"platforms\\\"></a>\\nTested & supported platforms\\n----------------------------\\n\\n  * **Linux**: including ARM platforms such as Raspberry Pi *and Kindle!*\\n  * **Mac OS**\\n  * **Solaris**: including Joyent's SmartOS & Nodejitsu\\n  * **Windows**: Node 0.10 and above only. See installation instructions for *node-gyp's* dependencies [here](https://github.com/TooTallNate/node-gyp#installation), you'll need these (free) components from Microsoft to compile and run any native Node add-on in Windows.\\n\\n<a name=\\\"basic\\\"></a>\\nBasic usage\\n-----------\\n\\nFirst you need to install LevelUP!\\n\\n```sh\\n$ npm install levelup leveldown\\n```\\n\\nOr\\n\\n```sh\\n$ npm install level\\n```\\n\\n*(this second option requires you to use LevelUP by calling `var levelup = require('level')`)*\\n\\n\\nAll operations are asynchronous although they don't necessarily require a callback if you don't need to know when the operation was performed.\\n\\n```js\\nvar levelup = require('levelup')\\n\\n// 1) Create our database, supply location and options.\\n//    This will create or open the underlying LevelDB store.\\nvar db = levelup('./mydb')\\n\\n// 2) put a key & value\\ndb.put('name', 'LevelUP', function (err) {\\n  if (err) return console.log('Ooops!', err) // some kind of I/O error\\n\\n  // 3) fetch by key\\n  db.get('name', function (err, value) {\\n    if (err) return console.log('Ooops!', err) // likely the key was not found\\n\\n    // ta da!\\n    console.log('name=' + value)\\n  })\\n})\\n```\\n\\n<a name=\\\"api\\\"></a>\\n## API\\n\\n  * <a href=\\\"#ctor\\\"><code><b>levelup()</b></code></a>\\n  * <a href=\\\"#open\\\"><code>db.<b>open()</b></code></a>\\n  * <a href=\\\"#close\\\"><code>db.<b>close()</b></code></a>\\n  * <a href=\\\"#put\\\"><code>db.<b>put()</b></code></a>\\n  * <a href=\\\"#get\\\"><code>db.<b>get()</b></code></a>\\n  * <a href=\\\"#del\\\"><code>db.<b>del()</b></code></a>\\n  * <a href=\\\"#batch\\\"><code>db.<b>batch()</b></code> *(array form)*</a>\\n  * <a href=\\\"#batch_chained\\\"><code>db.<b>batch()</b></code> *(chained form)*</a>\\n  * <a href=\\\"#isOpen\\\"><code>db.<b>isOpen()</b></code></a>\\n  * <a href=\\\"#isClosed\\\"><code>db.<b>isClosed()</b></code></a>\\n  * <a href=\\\"#createReadStream\\\"><code>db.<b>createReadStream()</b></code></a>\\n  * <a href=\\\"#createKeyStream\\\"><code>db.<b>createKeyStream()</b></code></a>\\n  * <a href=\\\"#createValueStream\\\"><code>db.<b>createValueStream()</b></code></a>\\n\\n### Special operations exposed by LevelDOWN\\n\\n  * <a href=\\\"#approximateSize\\\"><code>db.db.<b>approximateSize()</b></code></a>\\n  * <a href=\\\"#getProperty\\\"><code>db.db.<b>getProperty()</b></code></a>\\n  * <a href=\\\"#destroy\\\"><code><b>leveldown.destroy()</b></code></a>\\n  * <a href=\\\"#repair\\\"><code><b>leveldown.repair()</b></code></a>\\n\\n### Special Notes\\n  * <a href=\\\"#writeStreams\\\">What happened to <code><b>db.createWriteStream()</b></code></a>\\n\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------\\n<a name=\\\"ctor\\\"></a>\\n### levelup(location[, options[, callback]])\\n### levelup(options[, callback ])\\n### levelup(db[, callback ])\\n<code>levelup()</code> is the main entry point for creating a new LevelUP instance and opening the underlying store with LevelDB.\\n\\nThis function returns a new instance of LevelUP and will also initiate an <a href=\\\"#open\\\"><code>open()</code></a> operation. Opening the database is an asynchronous operation which will trigger your callback if you provide one. The callback should take the form: `function (err, db) {}` where the `db` is the LevelUP instance. If you don't provide a callback, any read & write operations are simply queued internally until the database is fully opened.\\n\\nThis leads to two alternative ways of managing a new LevelUP instance:\\n\\n```js\\nlevelup(location, options, function (err, db) {\\n  if (err) throw err\\n  db.get('foo', function (err, value) {\\n    if (err) return console.log('foo does not exist')\\n    console.log('got foo =', value)\\n  })\\n})\\n\\n// vs the equivalent:\\n\\nvar db = levelup(location, options) // will throw if an error occurs\\ndb.get('foo', function (err, value) {\\n  if (err) return console.log('foo does not exist')\\n  console.log('got foo =', value)\\n})\\n```\\n\\nThe `location` argument is available as a read-only property on the returned LevelUP instance.\\n\\nThe `levelup(options, callback)` form (with optional `callback`) is only available where you provide a valid `'db'` property on the options object (see below). Only for back-ends that don't require a `location` argument, such as [MemDOWN](https://github.com/level/memdown).\\n\\nFor example:\\n\\n```js\\nvar levelup = require('levelup')\\nvar memdown = require('memdown')\\nvar db = levelup({ db: memdown })\\n```\\n\\nThe `levelup(db, callback)` form (with optional `callback`) is only available where `db` is a factory function, as would be provided as a `'db'` property on an `options` object (see below). Only for back-ends that don't require a `location` argument, such as [MemDOWN](https://github.com/level/memdown).\\n\\nFor example:\\n\\n```js\\nvar levelup = require('levelup')\\nvar memdown = require('memdown')\\nvar db = levelup(memdown)\\n```\\n\\n#### `options`\\n\\n`levelup()` takes an optional options object as its second argument; the following properties are accepted:\\n\\n* `'createIfMissing'` *(boolean, default: `true`)*: If `true`, will initialise an empty database at the specified location if one doesn't already exist. If `false` and a database doesn't exist you will receive an error in your `open()` callback and your database won't open.\\n\\n* `'errorIfExists'` *(boolean, default: `false`)*: If `true`, you will receive an error in your `open()` callback if the database exists at the specified location.\\n\\n* `'compression'` *(boolean, default: `true`)*: If `true`, all *compressible* data will be run through the Snappy compression algorithm before being stored. Snappy is very fast and shouldn't gain much speed by disabling so leave this on unless you have good reason to turn it off.\\n\\n* `'cacheSize'` *(number, default: `8 * 1024 * 1024`)*: The size (in bytes) of the in-memory [LRU](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cache_algorithms#Least_Recently_Used) cache with frequently used uncompressed block contents.\\n\\n* `'keyEncoding'` and `'valueEncoding'` *(string, default: `'utf8'`)*: The encoding of the keys and values passed through Node.js' `Buffer` implementation (see [Buffer#toString()](http://nodejs.org/docs/latest/api/buffer.html#buffer_buf_tostring_encoding_start_end)).\\n  <p><code>'utf8'</code> is the default encoding for both keys and values so you can simply pass in strings and expect strings from your <code>get()</code> operations. You can also pass <code>Buffer</code> objects as keys and/or values and conversion will be performed.</p>\\n  <p>Supported encodings are: hex, utf8, ascii, binary, base64, ucs2, utf16le.</p>\\n  <p><code>'json'</code> encoding is also supported, see below.</p>\\n\\n* `'db'` *(object, default: LevelDOWN)*: LevelUP is backed by [LevelDOWN](https://github.com/level/leveldown/) to provide an interface to LevelDB. You can completely replace the use of LevelDOWN by providing a \\\"factory\\\" function that will return a LevelDOWN API compatible object given a `location` argument. For further information, see [MemDOWN](https://github.com/level/memdown), a fully LevelDOWN API compatible replacement that uses a memory store rather than LevelDB. Also see [Abstract LevelDOWN](http://github.com/level/abstract-leveldown), a partial implementation of the LevelDOWN API that can be used as a base prototype for a LevelDOWN substitute.\\n\\nAdditionally, each of the main interface methods accept an optional options object that can be used to override `'keyEncoding'` and `'valueEncoding'`.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------\\n<a name=\\\"open\\\"></a>\\n### db.open([callback])\\n<code>open()</code> opens the underlying LevelDB store. In general **you should never need to call this method directly** as it's automatically called by <a href=\\\"#ctor\\\"><code>levelup()</code></a>.\\n\\nHowever, it is possible to *reopen* a database after it has been closed with <a href=\\\"#close\\\"><code>close()</code></a>, although this is not generally advised.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------\\n<a name=\\\"close\\\"></a>\\n### db.close([callback])\\n<code>close()</code> closes the underlying LevelDB store. The callback will receive any error encountered during closing as the first argument.\\n\\nYou should always clean up your LevelUP instance by calling `close()` when you no longer need it to free up resources. A LevelDB store cannot be opened by multiple instances of LevelDB/LevelUP simultaneously.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------\\n<a name=\\\"put\\\"></a>\\n### db.put(key, value[, options][, callback])\\n<code>put()</code> is the primary method for inserting data into the store. Both the `key` and `value` can be arbitrary data objects.\\n\\nThe callback argument is optional but if you don't provide one and an error occurs then expect the error to be thrown.\\n\\n#### `options`\\n\\nEncoding of the `key` and `value` objects will adhere to `'keyEncoding'` and `'valueEncoding'` options provided to <a href=\\\"#ctor\\\"><code>levelup()</code></a>, although you can provide alternative encoding settings in the options for `put()` (it's recommended that you stay consistent in your encoding of keys and values in a single store).\\n\\nIf you provide a `'sync'` value of `true` in your `options` object, LevelDB will perform a synchronous write of the data; although the operation will be asynchronous as far as Node is concerned. Normally, LevelDB passes the data to the operating system for writing and returns immediately, however a synchronous write will use `fsync()` or equivalent so your callback won't be triggered until the data is actually on disk. Synchronous filesystem writes are **significantly** slower than asynchronous writes but if you want to be absolutely sure that the data is flushed then you can use `'sync': true`.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------\\n<a name=\\\"get\\\"></a>\\n### db.get(key[, options][, callback])\\n<code>get()</code> is the primary method for fetching data from the store. The `key` can be an arbitrary data object. If it doesn't exist in the store then the callback will receive an error as its first argument. A not-found err object will be of type `'NotFoundError'` so you can `err.type == 'NotFoundError'` or you can perform a truthy test on the property `err.notFound`.\\n\\n```js\\ndb.get('foo', function (err, value) {\\n  if (err) {\\n    if (err.notFound) {\\n      // handle a 'NotFoundError' here\\n      return\\n    }\\n    // I/O or other error, pass it up the callback chain\\n    return callback(err)\\n  }\\n\\n  // .. handle `value` here\\n})\\n```\\n\\n#### `options`\\n\\nEncoding of the `key` and `value` objects is the same as in <a href=\\\"#put\\\"><code>put</code></a>. \\n\\nLevelDB will by default fill the in-memory LRU Cache with data from a call to get. Disabling this is done by setting `fillCache` to `false`.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------\\n<a name=\\\"del\\\"></a>\\n### db.del(key[, options][, callback])\\n<code>del()</code> is the primary method for removing data from the store.\\n```js\\ndb.del('foo', function (err) {\\n  if (err)\\n    // handle I/O or other error\\n});\\n```\\n\\n#### `options`\\n\\nEncoding of the `key` object will adhere to the `'keyEncoding'` option provided to <a href=\\\"#ctor\\\"><code>levelup()</code></a>, although you can provide alternative encoding settings in the options for `del()` (it's recommended that you stay consistent in your encoding of keys and values in a single store).\\n\\nA `'sync'` option can also be passed, see <a href=\\\"#put\\\"><code>put()</code></a> for details on how this works.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------\\n<a name=\\\"batch\\\"></a>\\n### db.batch(array[, options][, callback]) *(array form)*\\n<code>batch()</code> can be used for very fast bulk-write operations (both *put* and *delete*). The `array` argument should contain a list of operations to be executed sequentially, although as a whole they are performed as an atomic operation inside LevelDB.\\n\\nEach operation is contained in an object having the following properties: `type`, `key`, `value`, where the *type* is either `'put'` or `'del'`. In the case of `'del'` the `'value'` property is ignored. Any entries with a `'key'` of `null` or `undefined` will cause an error to be returned on the `callback` and any `'type': 'put'` entry with a `'value'` of `null` or `undefined` will return an error.\\n\\nIf `key` and `value` are defined but `type` is not, it will default to `'put'`.\\n\\n```js\\nvar ops = [\\n    { type: 'del', key: 'father' }\\n  , { type: 'put', key: 'name', value: 'Yuri Irsenovich Kim' }\\n  , { type: 'put', key: 'dob', value: '16 February 1941' }\\n  , { type: 'put', key: 'spouse', value: 'Kim Young-sook' }\\n  , { type: 'put', key: 'occupation', value: 'Clown' }\\n]\\n\\ndb.batch(ops, function (err) {\\n  if (err) return console.log('Ooops!', err)\\n  console.log('Great success dear leader!')\\n})\\n```\\n\\n#### `options`\\n\\nSee <a href=\\\"#put\\\"><code>put()</code></a> for a discussion on the `options` object. You can overwrite default `'keyEncoding'` and `'valueEncoding'` and also specify the use of `sync` filesystem operations.\\n\\nIn addition to encoding options for the whole batch you can also overwrite the encoding per operation, like:\\n\\n```js\\nvar ops = [{\\n    type          : 'put'\\n  , key           : new Buffer([1, 2, 3])\\n  , value         : { some: 'json' }\\n  , keyEncoding   : 'binary'\\n  , valueEncoding : 'json'\\n}]\\n```\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------\\n<a name=\\\"batch_chained\\\"></a>\\n### db.batch() *(chained form)*\\n<code>batch()</code>, when called with no arguments will return a `Batch` object which can be used to build, and eventually commit, an atomic LevelDB batch operation. Depending on how it's used, it is possible to obtain greater performance when using the chained form of `batch()` over the array form.\\n\\n```js\\ndb.batch()\\n  .del('father')\\n  .put('name', 'Yuri Irsenovich Kim')\\n  .put('dob', '16 February 1941')\\n  .put('spouse', 'Kim Young-sook')\\n  .put('occupation', 'Clown')\\n  .write(function () { console.log('Done!') })\\n```\\n\\n<b><code>batch.put(key, value[, options])</code></b>\\n\\nQueue a *put* operation on the current batch, not committed until a `write()` is called on the batch.\\n\\nThe optional `options` argument can be used to override the default `'keyEncoding'` and/or `'valueEncoding'`.\\n\\nThis method may `throw` a `WriteError` if there is a problem with your put (such as the `value` being `null` or `undefined`).\\n\\n<b><code>batch.del(key[, options])</code></b>\\n\\nQueue a *del* operation on the current batch, not committed until a `write()` is called on the batch.\\n\\nThe optional `options` argument can be used to override the default `'keyEncoding'`.\\n\\nThis method may `throw` a `WriteError` if there is a problem with your delete.\\n\\n<b><code>batch.clear()</code></b>\\n\\nClear all queued operations on the current batch, any previous operations will be discarded.\\n\\n<b><code>batch.length</code></b>\\n\\nThe number of queued operations on the current batch.\\n\\n<b><code>batch.write([callback])</code></b>\\n\\nCommit the queued operations for this batch. All operations not *cleared* will be written to the database atomically, that is, they will either all succeed or fail with no partial commits. The optional `callback` will be called when the operation has completed with an *error* argument if an error has occurred; if no `callback` is supplied and an error occurs then this method will `throw` a `WriteError`.\\n\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------\\n<a name=\\\"isOpen\\\"></a>\\n### db.isOpen()\\n\\nA LevelUP object can be in one of the following states:\\n\\n  * *\\\"new\\\"*     - newly created, not opened or closed\\n  * *\\\"opening\\\"* - waiting for the database to be opened\\n  * *\\\"open\\\"*    - successfully opened the database, available for use\\n  * *\\\"closing\\\"* - waiting for the database to be closed\\n  * *\\\"closed\\\"*  - database has been successfully closed, should not be used\\n\\n`isOpen()` will return `true` only when the state is \\\"open\\\".\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------\\n<a name=\\\"isClosed\\\"></a>\\n### db.isClosed()\\n\\n*See <a href=\\\"#put\\\"><code>isOpen()</code></a>*\\n\\n`isClosed()` will return `true` only when the state is \\\"closing\\\" *or* \\\"closed\\\", it can be useful for determining if read and write operations are permissible.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------\\n<a name=\\\"createReadStream\\\"></a>\\n### db.createReadStream([options])\\n\\nYou can obtain a **ReadStream** of the full database by calling the `createReadStream()` method. The resulting stream is a complete Node.js-style [Readable Stream](http://nodejs.org/docs/latest/api/stream.html#stream_readable_stream) where `'data'` events emit objects with `'key'` and `'value'` pairs. You can also use the `gt`, `lt` and `limit` options to control the range of keys that are streamed.\\n\\n```js\\ndb.createReadStream()\\n  .on('data', function (data) {\\n    console.log(data.key, '=', data.value)\\n  })\\n  .on('error', function (err) {\\n    console.log('Oh my!', err)\\n  })\\n  .on('close', function () {\\n    console.log('Stream closed')\\n  })\\n  .on('end', function () {\\n    console.log('Stream closed')\\n  })\\n```\\n\\nThe standard `pause()`, `resume()` and `destroy()` methods are implemented on the ReadStream, as is `pipe()` (see below). `'data'`, '`error'`, `'end'` and `'close'` events are emitted.\\n\\nAdditionally, you can supply an options object as the first parameter to `createReadStream()` with the following options:\\n\\n* `'gt'` (greater than), `'gte'` (greater than or equal) define the lower bound of the range to be streamed. Only records where the key is greater than (or equal to) this option will be included in the range. When `reverse=true` the order will be reversed, but the records streamed will be the same.\\n\\n* `'lt'` (less than), `'lte'` (less than or equal) define the higher bound of the range to be streamed. Only key/value pairs where the key is less than (or equal to) this option will be included in the range. When `reverse=true` the order will be reversed, but the records streamed will be the same.\\n\\n* `'start', 'end'` legacy ranges - instead use `'gte', 'lte'`\\n\\n* `'reverse'` *(boolean, default: `false`)*: a boolean, set true and the stream output will be reversed. Beware that due to the way LevelDB works, a reverse seek will be slower than a forward seek.\\n\\n* `'keys'` *(boolean, default: `true`)*: whether the `'data'` event should contain keys. If set to `true` and `'values'` set to `false` then `'data'` events will simply be keys, rather than objects with a `'key'` property. Used internally by the `createKeyStream()` method.\\n\\n* `'values'` *(boolean, default: `true`)*: whether the `'data'` event should contain values. If set to `true` and `'keys'` set to `false` then `'data'` events will simply be values, rather than objects with a `'value'` property. Used internally by the `createValueStream()` method.\\n\\n* `'limit'` *(number, default: `-1`)*: limit the number of results collected by this stream. This number represents a *maximum* number of results and may not be reached if you get to the end of the data first. A value of `-1` means there is no limit. When `reverse=true` the highest keys will be returned instead of the lowest keys.\\n\\n* `'fillCache'` *(boolean, default: `false`)*: whether LevelDB's LRU-cache should be filled with data read.\\n\\n* `'keyEncoding'` / `'valueEncoding'` *(string)*: the encoding applied to each read piece of data.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------\\n<a name=\\\"createKeyStream\\\"></a>\\n### db.createKeyStream([options])\\n\\nA **KeyStream** is a **ReadStream** where the `'data'` events are simply the keys from the database so it can be used like a traditional stream rather than an object stream.\\n\\nYou can obtain a KeyStream either by calling the `createKeyStream()` method on a LevelUP object or by passing an options object to `createReadStream()` with `keys` set to `true` and `values` set to `false`.\\n\\n```js\\ndb.createKeyStream()\\n  .on('data', function (data) {\\n    console.log('key=', data)\\n  })\\n\\n// same as:\\ndb.createReadStream({ keys: true, values: false })\\n  .on('data', function (data) {\\n    console.log('key=', data)\\n  })\\n```\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------\\n<a name=\\\"createValueStream\\\"></a>\\n### db.createValueStream([options])\\n\\nA **ValueStream** is a **ReadStream** where the `'data'` events are simply the values from the database so it can be used like a traditional stream rather than an object stream.\\n\\nYou can obtain a ValueStream either by calling the `createValueStream()` method on a LevelUP object or by passing an options object to `createReadStream()` with `values` set to `true` and `keys` set to `false`.\\n\\n```js\\ndb.createValueStream()\\n  .on('data', function (data) {\\n    console.log('value=', data)\\n  })\\n\\n// same as:\\ndb.createReadStream({ keys: false, values: true })\\n  .on('data', function (data) {\\n    console.log('value=', data)\\n  })\\n```\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------\\n<a name=\\\"writeStreams\\\"></a>\\n#### What happened to `db.createWriteStream`?\\n\\n`db.createWriteStream()` has been removed in order to provide a smaller and more maintainable core. It primarily existed to create symmetry with `db.createReadStream()` but through much [discussion](https://github.com/level/levelup/issues/199), removing it was the best cause of action.\\n\\nThe main driver for this was performance. While `db.createReadStream()` performs well under most use cases, `db.createWriteStream()` was highly dependent on the application keys and values. Thus we can't provide a standard implementation and encourage more `write-stream` implementations to be created to solve the broad spectrum of use cases.\\n\\nCheck out the implementations that the community has already produced [here](https://github.com/level/levelup/wiki/Modules#write-streams).\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------\\n<a name='approximateSize'></a>\\n### db.db.approximateSize(start, end, callback)\\n<code>approximateSize()</code> can used to get the approximate number of bytes of file system space used by the range `[start..end)`. The result may not include recently written data.\\n\\n```js\\nvar db = require('level')('./huge.db')\\n\\ndb.db.approximateSize('a', 'c', function (err, size) {\\n  if (err) return console.error('Ooops!', err)\\n  console.log('Approximate size of range is %d', size)\\n})\\n```\\n\\n**Note:** `approximateSize()` is available via [LevelDOWN](https://github.com/level/leveldown/), which by default is accessible as the `db` property of your LevelUP instance. This is a specific LevelDB operation and is not likely to be available where you replace LevelDOWN with an alternative back-end via the `'db'` option.\\n\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------\\n<a name='getProperty'></a>\\n### db.db.getProperty(property)\\n<code>getProperty</code> can be used to get internal details from LevelDB. When issued with a valid property string, a readable string will be returned (this method is synchronous).\\n\\nCurrently, the only valid properties are:\\n\\n* <b><code>'leveldb.num-files-at-levelN'</code></b>: returns the number of files at level *N*, where N is an integer representing a valid level (e.g. \\\"0\\\").\\n\\n* <b><code>'leveldb.stats'</code></b>: returns a multi-line string describing statistics about LevelDB's internal operation.\\n\\n* <b><code>'leveldb.sstables'</code></b>: returns a multi-line string describing all of the *sstables* that make up contents of the current database.\\n\\n\\n```js\\nvar db = require('level')('./huge.db')\\nconsole.log(db.db.getProperty('leveldb.num-files-at-level3'))\\n// → '243'\\n```\\n\\n**Note:** `getProperty()` is available via [LevelDOWN](https://github.com/level/leveldown/), which by default is accessible as the `db` property of your LevelUP instance. This is a specific LevelDB operation and is not likely to be available where you replace LevelDOWN with an alternative back-end via the `'db'` option.\\n\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------\\n<a name=\\\"destroy\\\"></a>\\n### leveldown.destroy(location, callback)\\n<code>destroy()</code> is used to completely remove an existing LevelDB database directory. You can use this function in place of a full directory *rm* if you want to be sure to only remove LevelDB-related files. If the directory only contains LevelDB files, the directory itself will be removed as well. If there are additional, non-LevelDB files in the directory, those files, and the directory, will be left alone.\\n\\nThe callback will be called when the destroy operation is complete, with a possible `error` argument.\\n\\n**Note:** `destroy()` is available via [LevelDOWN](https://github.com/level/leveldown/) which you will have to install seperately, e.g.:\\n\\n```js\\nrequire('leveldown').destroy('./huge.db', function (err) { console.log('done!') })\\n```\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------\\n<a name=\\\"repair\\\"></a>\\n### leveldown.repair(location, callback)\\n<code>repair()</code> can be used to attempt a restoration of a damaged LevelDB store. From the LevelDB documentation:\\n\\n> If a DB cannot be opened, you may attempt to call this method to resurrect as much of the contents of the database as possible. Some data may be lost, so be careful when calling this function on a database that contains important information.\\n\\nYou will find information on the *repair* operation in the *LOG* file inside the store directory.\\n\\nA `repair()` can also be used to perform a compaction of the LevelDB log into table files.\\n\\nThe callback will be called when the repair operation is complete, with a possible `error` argument.\\n\\n**Note:** `repair()` is available via [LevelDOWN](https://github.com/level/leveldown/) which you will have to install seperately, e.g.:\\n\\n```js\\nrequire('leveldown').repair('./huge.db', function (err) { console.log('done!') })\\n```\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n<a name=\\\"events\\\"></a>\\nEvents\\n------\\n\\nLevelUP emits events when the callbacks to the corresponding methods are called.\\n\\n* `db.emit('put', key, value)` emitted when a new value is `'put'`\\n* `db.emit('del', key)` emitted when a value is deleted\\n* `db.emit('batch', ary)` emitted when a batch operation has executed\\n* `db.emit('ready')` emitted when the database has opened (`'open'` is synonym)\\n* `db.emit('closed')` emitted when the database has closed\\n* `db.emit('opening')` emitted when the database is opening\\n* `db.emit('closing')` emitted when the database is closing\\n\\nIf you do not pass a callback to an async function, and there is an error, LevelUP will `emit('error', err)` instead.\\n\\n<a name=\\\"json\\\"></a>\\nJSON data\\n---------\\n\\nYou specify `'json'` encoding for both keys and/or values, you can then supply JavaScript objects to LevelUP and receive them from all fetch operations, including ReadStreams. LevelUP will automatically *stringify* your objects and store them as *utf8* and parse the strings back into objects before passing them back to you.\\n\\n<a name=\\\"custom_encodings\\\"></a>\\nCustom encodings\\n----------------\\n\\nA custom encoding may be provided by passing in an object as an value for `keyEncoding` or `valueEncoding` (wherever accepted), it must have the following properties:\\n\\n```js\\n{\\n    encode : function (val) { ... }\\n  , decode : function (val) { ... }\\n  , buffer : boolean // encode returns a buffer and decode accepts a buffer\\n  , type   : String  // name of this encoding type.\\n}\\n```\\n\\n<a name=\\\"extending\\\"></a>\\nExtending LevelUP\\n-----------------\\n\\nA list of <a href=\\\"https://github.com/level/levelup/wiki/Modules\\\"><b>Node.js LevelDB modules and projects</b></a> can be found in the wiki.\\n\\nWhen attempting to extend the functionality of LevelUP, it is recommended that you consider using [level-hooks](https://github.com/dominictarr/level-hooks) and/or [level-sublevel](https://github.com/dominictarr/level-sublevel). **level-sublevel** is particularly helpful for keeping additional, extension-specific, data in a LevelDB store. It allows you to partition a LevelUP instance into multiple sub-instances that each correspond to discrete namespaced key ranges.\\n\\n<a name=\\\"multiproc\\\"></a>\\nMulti-process access\\n--------------------\\n\\nLevelDB is thread-safe but is **not** suitable for accessing with multiple processes. You should only ever have a LevelDB database open from a single Node.js process. Node.js clusters are made up of multiple processes so a LevelUP instance cannot be shared between them either.\\n\\nSee the <a href=\\\"https://github.com/level/levelup/wiki/Modules\\\"><b>wiki</b></a> for some LevelUP extensions, including [multilevel](https://github.com/juliangruber/multilevel), that may help if you require a single data store to be shared across processes.\\n\\n<a name=\\\"support\\\"></a>\\nGetting support\\n---------------\\n\\nThere are multiple ways you can find help in using LevelDB in Node.js:\\n\\n * **IRC:** you'll find an active group of LevelUP users in the **##leveldb** channel on Freenode, including most of the contributors to this project.\\n * **Mailing list:** there is an active [Node.js LevelDB](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/node-levelup) Google Group.\\n * **GitHub:** you're welcome to open an issue here on this GitHub repository if you have a question.\\n\\n<a name=\\\"contributing\\\"></a>\\nContributing\\n------------\\n\\nLevelUP is an **OPEN Open Source Project**.

BigTable. It's used in Google Chrome and many other products. LevelDB supports arbitrary byte arrays as both keys and values, singular *get*, *put* and *delete* operations, *batched put and delete*, bi-directional iterators and simple compression using the very fast [Snappy](http://google.github.io/snappy/) algorithm.\\n\\n**LevelUP** aims to expose the features of LevelDB in a **Node.js-friendly way**. All standard `Buffer` encoding types are supported, as is a special JSON encoding. LevelDB's iterators are exposed as a Node.js-style **readable stream**.\\n\\nLevelDB stores entries **sorted lexicographically by keys**. This makes LevelUP's <a href=\\\"#createReadStream\\\"><code>ReadStream</code></a> interface a very powerful query mechanism.\\n\\n**LevelUP** is an **OPEN Open Source Project**, see the <a href=\\\"#contributing\\\">Contributing</a> section to find out what this means.\\n\\n<a name=\\\"leveldown\\\"></a>\\nRelationship to LevelDOWN\\n-------------------------\\n\\nLevelUP is designed to be backed by **[LevelDOWN](https://github.com/level/leveldown/)** which provides a pure C++ binding to LevelDB and can be used as a stand-alone package if required.\\n\\n**As of version 0.9, LevelUP no longer requires LevelDOWN as a dependency so you must `npm install leveldown` when you install LevelUP.**\\n\\nLevelDOWN is now optional because LevelUP can be used with alternative backends, such as **[level.js](https://github.com/maxogden/level.js)** in the browser or [MemDOWN](https://github.com/level/memdown) for a pure in-memory store.\\n\\nLevelUP will look for LevelDOWN and throw an error if it can't find it in its Node `require()` path. It will also tell you if the installed version of LevelDOWN is incompatible.\\n\\n**The [level](https://github.com/level/level) package is available as an alternative installation mechanism.** Install it instead to automatically get both LevelUP & LevelDOWN. It exposes LevelUP on its export (i.e. you can `var leveldb = require('level')`).\\n\\n\\n<a name=\\\"platforms\\\"></a>\\nTested & supported platforms\\n----------------------------\\n\\n  * **Linux**: including ARM platforms such as Raspberry Pi *and Kindle!*\\n  * **Mac OS**\\n  * **Solaris**: including Joyent's SmartOS & Nodejitsu\\n  * **Windows**: Node 0.10 and above only. See installation instructions for *node-gyp's* dependencies [here](https://github.com/TooTallNate/node-gyp#installation), you'll need these (free) components from Microsoft to compile and run any native Node add-on in Windows.\\n\\n<a name=\\\"basic\\\"></a>\\nBasic usage\\n-----------\\n\\nFirst you need to install LevelUP!\\n\\n```sh\\n$ npm install levelup leveldown\\n```\\n\\nOr\\n\\n```sh\\n$ npm install level\\n```\\n\\n*(this second option requires you to use LevelUP by calling `var levelup = require('level')`)*\\n\\n\\nAll operations are asynchronous although they don't necessarily require a callback if you don't need to know when the operation was performed.\\n\\n```js\\nvar levelup = require('levelup')\\n\\n// 1) Create our database, supply location and options.\\n//    This will create or open the underlying LevelDB store.\\nvar db = levelup('./mydb')\\n\\n// 2) put a key & value\\ndb.put('name', 'LevelUP', function (err) {\\n  if (err) return console.log('Ooops!', err) // some kind of I/O error\\n\\n  // 3) fetch by key\\n  db.get('name', function (err, value) {\\n    if (err) return console.log('Ooops!', err) // likely the key was not found\\n\\n    // ta da!\\n    console.log('name=' + value)\\n  })\\n})\\n```\\n\\n<a name=\\\"api\\\"></a>\\n## API\\n\\n  * <a href=\\\"#ctor\\\"><code><b>levelup()</b></code></a>\\n  * <a href=\\\"#open\\\"><code>db.<b>open()</b></code></a>\\n  * <a href=\\\"#close\\\"><code>db.<b>close()</b></code></a>\\n  * <a href=\\\"#put\\\"><code>db.<b>put()</b></code></a>\\n  * <a href=\\\"#get\\\"><code>db.<b>get()</b></code></a>\\n  * <a href=\\\"#del\\\"><code>db.<b>del()</b></code></a>\\n  * <a href=\\\"#batch\\\"><code>db.<b>batch()</b></code> *(array form)*</a>\\n  * <a href=\\\"#batch_chained\\\"><code>db.<b>batch()</b></code> *(chained form)*</a>\\n  * <a href=\\\"#isOpen\\\"><code>db.<b>isOpen()</b></code></a>\\n  * <a href=\\\"#isClosed\\\"><code>db.<b>isClosed()</b></code></a>\\n  * <a href=\\\"#createReadStream\\\"><code>db.<b>createReadStream()</b></code></a>\\n  * <a href=\\\"#createKeyStream\\\"><code>db.<b>createKeyStream()</b></code></a>\\n  * <a href=\\\"#createValueStream\\\"><code>db.<b>createValueStream()</b></code></a>\\n\\n### Special operations exposed by LevelDOWN\\n\\n  * <a href=\\\"#approximateSize\\\"><code>db.db.<b>approximateSize()</b></code></a>\\n  * <a href=\\\"#getProperty\\\"><code>db.db.<b>getProperty()</b></code></a>\\n  * <a href=\\\"#destroy\\\"><code><b>leveldown.destroy()</b></code></a>\\n  * <a href=\\\"#repair\\\"><code><b>leveldown.repair()</b></code></a>\\n\\n### Special Notes\\n  * <a href=\\\"#writeStreams\\\">What happened to <code><b>db.createWriteStream()</b></code></a>\\n\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------\\n<a name=\\\"ctor\\\"></a>\\n### levelup(location[, options[, callback]])\\n### levelup(options[, callback ])\\n### levelup(db[, callback ])\\n<code>levelup()</code> is the main entry point for creating a new LevelUP instance and opening the underlying store with LevelDB.\\n\\nThis function returns a new instance of LevelUP and will also initiate an <a href=\\\"#open\\\"><code>open()</code></a> operation. Opening the database is an asynchronous operation which will trigger your callback if you provide one. The callback should take the form: `function (err, db) {}` where the `db` is the LevelUP instance. If you don't provide a callback, any read & write operations are simply queued internally until the database is fully opened.\\n\\nThis leads to two alternative ways of managing a new LevelUP instance:\\n\\n```js\\nlevelup(location, options, function (err, db) {\\n  if (err) throw err\\n  db.get('foo', function (err, value) {\\n    if (err) return console.log('foo does not exist')\\n    console.log('got foo =', value)\\n  })\\n})\\n\\n// vs the equivalent:\\n\\nvar db = levelup(location, options) // will throw if an error occurs\\ndb.get('foo', function (err, value) {\\n  if (err) return console.log('foo does not exist')\\n  console.log('got foo =', value)\\n})\\n```\\n\\nThe `location` argument is available as a read-only property on the returned LevelUP instance.\\n\\nThe `levelup(options, callback)` form (with optional `callback`) is only available where you provide a valid `'db'` property on the options object (see below). Only for back-ends that don't require a `location` argument, such as [MemDOWN](https://github.com/level/memdown).\\n\\nFor example:\\n\\n```js\\nvar levelup = require('levelup')\\nvar memdown = require('memdown')\\nvar db = levelup({ db: memdown })\\n```\\n\\nThe `levelup(db, callback)` form (with optional `callback`) is only available where `db` is a factory function, as would be provided as a `'db'` property on an `options` object (see below). Only for back-ends that don't require a `location` argument, such as [MemDOWN](https://github.com/level/memdown).\\n\\nFor example:\\n\\n```js\\nvar levelup = require('levelup')\\nvar memdown = require('memdown')\\nvar db = levelup(memdown)\\n```\\n\\n#### `options`\\n\\n`levelup()` takes an optional options object as its second argument; the following properties are accepted:\\n\\n* `'createIfMissing'` *(boolean, default: `true`)*: If `true`, will initialise an empty database at the specified location if one doesn't already exist. If `false` and a database doesn't exist you will receive an error in your `open()` callback and your database won't open.\\n\\n* `'errorIfExists'` *(boolean, default: `false`)*: If `true`, you will receive an error in your `open()` callback if the database exists at the specified location.\\n\\n* `'compression'` *(boolean, default: `true`)*: If `true`, all *compressible* data will be run through the Snappy compression algorithm before being stored. Snappy is very fast and shouldn't gain much speed by disabling so leave this on unless you have good reason to turn it off.\\n\\n* `'cacheSize'` *(number, default: `8 * 1024 * 1024`)*: The size (in bytes) of the in-memory [LRU](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cache_algorithms#Least_Recently_Used) cache with frequently used uncompressed block contents.\\n\\n* `'keyEncoding'` and `'valueEncoding'` *(string, default: `'utf8'`)*: The encoding of the keys and values passed through Node.js' `Buffer` implementation (see [Buffer#toString()](http://nodejs.org/docs/latest/api/buffer.html#buffer_buf_tostring_encoding_start_end)).\\n  <p><code>'utf8'</code> is the default encoding for both keys and values so you can simply pass in strings and expect strings from your <code>get()</code> operations. You can also pass <code>Buffer</code> objects as keys and/or values and conversion will be performed.</p>\\n  <p>Supported encodings are: hex, utf8, ascii, binary, base64, ucs2, utf16le.</p>\\n  <p><code>'json'</code> encoding is also supported, see below.</p>\\n\\n* `'db'` *(object, default: LevelDOWN)*: LevelUP is backed by [LevelDOWN](https://github.com/level/leveldown/) to provide an interface to LevelDB. You can completely replace the use of LevelDOWN by providing a \\\"factory\\\" function that will return a LevelDOWN API compatible object given a `location` argument. For further information, see [MemDOWN](https://github.com/level/memdown), a fully LevelDOWN API compatible replacement that uses a memory store rather than LevelDB. Also see [Abstract LevelDOWN](http://github.com/level/abstract-leveldown), a partial implementation of the LevelDOWN API that can be used as a base prototype for a LevelDOWN substitute.\\n\\nAdditionally, each of the main interface methods accept an optional options object that can be used to override `'keyEncoding'` and `'valueEncoding'`.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------\\n<a name=\\\"open\\\"></a>\\n### db.open([callback])\\n<code>open()</code> opens the underlying LevelDB store. In general **you should never need to call this method directly** as it's automatically called by <a href=\\\"#ctor\\\"><code>levelup()</code></a>.\\n\\nHowever, it is possible to *reopen* a database after it has been closed with <a href=\\\"#close\\\"><code>close()</code></a>, although this is not generally advised.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------\\n<a name=\\\"close\\\"></a>\\n### db.close([callback])\\n<code>close()</code> closes the underlying LevelDB store. The callback will receive any error encountered during closing as the first argument.\\n\\nYou should always clean up your LevelUP instance by calling `close()` when you no longer need it to free up resources. A LevelDB store cannot be opened by multiple instances of LevelDB/LevelUP simultaneously.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------\\n<a name=\\\"put\\\"></a>\\n### db.put(key, value[, options][, callback])\\n<code>put()</code> is the primary method for inserting data into the store. Both the `key` and `value` can be arbitrary data objects.\\n\\nThe callback argument is optional but if you don't provide one and an error occurs then expect the error to be thrown.\\n\\n#### `options`\\n\\nEncoding of the `key` and `value` objects will adhere to `'keyEncoding'` and `'valueEncoding'` options provided to <a href=\\\"#ctor\\\"><code>levelup()</code></a>, although you can provide alternative encoding settings in the options for `put()` (it's recommended that you stay consistent in your encoding of keys and values in a single store).\\n\\nIf you provide a `'sync'` value of `true` in your `options` object, LevelDB will perform a synchronous write of the data; although the operation will be asynchronous as far as Node is concerned. Normally, LevelDB passes the data to the operating system for writing and returns immediately, however a synchronous write will use `fsync()` or equivalent so your callback won't be triggered until the data is actually on disk. Synchronous filesystem writes are **significantly** slower than asynchronous writes but if you want to be absolutely sure that the data is flushed then you can use `'sync': true`.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------\\n<a name=\\\"get\\\"></a>\\n### db.get(key[, options][, callback])\\n<code>get()</code> is the primary method for fetching data from the store. The `key` can be an arbitrary data object. If it doesn't exist in the store then the callback will receive an error as its first argument. A not-found err object will be of type `'NotFoundError'` so you can `err.type == 'NotFoundError'` or you can perform a truthy test on the property `err.notFound`.\\n\\n```js\\ndb.get('foo', function (err, value) {\\n  if (err) {\\n    if (err.notFound) {\\n      // handle a 'NotFoundError' here\\n      return\\n    }\\n    // I/O or other error, pass it up the callback chain\\n    return callback(err)\\n  }\\n\\n  // .. handle `value` here\\n})\\n```\\n\\n#### `options`\\n\\nEncoding of the `key` and `value` objects is the same as in <a href=\\\"#put\\\"><code>put</code></a>. \\n\\nLevelDB will by default fill the in-memory LRU Cache with data from a call to get. Disabling this is done by setting `fillCache` to `false`.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------\\n<a name=\\\"del\\\"></a>\\n### db.del(key[, options][, callback])\\n<code>del()</code> is the primary method for removing data from the store.\\n```js\\ndb.del('foo', function (err) {\\n  if (err)\\n    // handle I/O or other error\\n});\\n```\\n\\n#### `options`\\n\\nEncoding of the `key` object will adhere to the `'keyEncoding'` option provided to <a href=\\\"#ctor\\\"><code>levelup()</code></a>, although you can provide alternative encoding settings in the options for `del()` (it's recommended that you stay consistent in your encoding of keys and values in a single store).\\n\\nA `'sync'` option can also be passed, see <a href=\\\"#put\\\"><code>put()</code></a> for details on how this works.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------\\n<a name=\\\"batch\\\"></a>\\n### db.batch(array[, options][, callback]) *(array form)*\\n<code>batch()</code> can be used for very fast bulk-write operations (both *put* and *delete*). The `array` argument should contain a list of operations to be executed sequentially, although as a whole they are performed as an atomic operation inside LevelDB.\\n\\nEach operation is contained in an object having the following properties: `type`, `key`, `value`, where the *type* is either `'put'` or `'del'`. In the case of `'del'` the `'value'` property is ignored. Any entries with a `'key'` of `null` or `undefined` will cause an error to be returned on the `callback` and any `'type': 'put'` entry with a `'value'` of `null` or `undefined` will return an error.\\n\\nIf `key` and `value` are defined but `type` is not, it will default to `'put'`.\\n\\n```js\\nvar ops = [\\n    { type: 'del', key: 'father' }\\n  , { type: 'put', key: 'name', value: 'Yuri Irsenovich Kim' }\\n  , { type: 'put', key: 'dob', value: '16 February 1941' }\\n  , { type: 'put', key: 'spouse', value: 'Kim Young-sook' }\\n  , { type: 'put', key: 'occupation', value: 'Clown' }\\n]\\n\\ndb.batch(ops, function (err) {\\n  if (err) return console.log('Ooops!', err)\\n  console.log('Great success dear leader!')\\n})\\n```\\n\\n#### `options`\\n\\nSee <a href=\\\"#put\\\"><code>put()</code></a> for a discussion on the `options` object. You can overwrite default `'keyEncoding'` and `'valueEncoding'` and also specify the use of `sync` filesystem operations.\\n\\nIn addition to encoding options for the whole batch you can also overwrite the encoding per operation, like:\\n\\n```js\\nvar ops = [{\\n    type          : 'put'\\n  , key           : new Buffer([1, 2, 3])\\n  , value         : { some: 'json' }\\n  , keyEncoding   : 'binary'\\n  , valueEncoding : 'json'\\n}]\\n```\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------\\n<a name=\\\"batch_chained\\\"></a>\\n### db.batch() *(chained form)*\\n<code>batch()</code>, when called with no arguments will return a `Batch` object which can be used to build, and eventually commit, an atomic LevelDB batch operation. Depending on how it's used, it is possible to obtain greater performance when using the chained form of `batch()` over the array form.\\n\\n```js\\ndb.batch()\\n  .del('father')\\n  .put('name', 'Yuri Irsenovich Kim')\\n  .put('dob', '16 February 1941')\\n  .put('spouse', 'Kim Young-sook')\\n  .put('occupation', 'Clown')\\n  .write(function () { console.log('Done!') })\\n```\\n\\n<b><code>batch.put(key, value[, options])</code></b>\\n\\nQueue a *put* operation on the current batch, not committed until a `write()` is called on the batch.\\n\\nThe optional `options` argument can be used to override the default `'keyEncoding'` and/or `'valueEncoding'`.\\n\\nThis method may `throw` a `WriteError` if there is a problem with your put (such as the `value` being `null` or `undefined`).\\n\\n<b><code>batch.del(key[, options])</code></b>\\n\\nQueue a *del* operation on the current batch, not committed until a `write()` is called on the batch.\\n\\nThe optional `options` argument can be used to override the default `'keyEncoding'`.\\n\\nThis method may `throw` a `WriteError` if there is a problem with your delete.\\n\\n<b><code>batch.clear()</code></b>\\n\\nClear all queued operations on the current batch, any previous operations will be discarded.\\n\\n<b><code>batch.length</code></b>\\n\\nThe number of queued operations on the current batch.\\n\\n<b><code>batch.write([callback])</code></b>\\n\\nCommit the queued operations for this batch. All operations not *cleared* will be written to the database atomically, that is, they will either all succeed or fail with no partial commits. The optional `callback` will be called when the operation has completed with an *error* argument if an error has occurred; if no `callback` is supplied and an error occurs then this method will `throw` a `WriteError`.\\n\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------\\n<a name=\\\"isOpen\\\"></a>\\n### db.isOpen()\\n\\nA LevelUP object can be in one of the following states:\\n\\n  * *\\\"new\\\"*     - newly created, not opened or closed\\n  * *\\\"opening\\\"* - waiting for the database to be opened\\n  * *\\\"open\\\"*    - successfully opened the database, available for use\\n  * *\\\"closing\\\"* - waiting for the database to be closed\\n  * *\\\"closed\\\"*  - database has been successfully closed, should not be used\\n\\n`isOpen()` will return `true` only when the state is \\\"open\\\".\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------\\n<a name=\\\"isClosed\\\"></a>\\n### db.isClosed()\\n\\n*See <a href=\\\"#put\\\"><code>isOpen()</code></a>*\\n\\n`isClosed()` will return `true` only when the state is \\\"closing\\\" *or* \\\"closed\\\", it can be useful for determining if read and write operations are permissible.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------\\n<a name=\\\"createReadStream\\\"></a>\\n### db.createReadStream([options])\\n\\nYou can obtain a **ReadStream** of the full database by calling the `createReadStream()` method. The resulting stream is a complete Node.js-style [Readable Stream](http://nodejs.org/docs/latest/api/stream.html#stream_readable_stream) where `'data'` events emit objects with `'key'` and `'value'` pairs. You can also use the `gt`, `lt` and `limit` options to control the range of keys that are streamed.\\n\\n```js\\ndb.createReadStream()\\n  .on('data', function (data) {\\n    console.log(data.key, '=', data.value)\\n  })\\n  .on('error', function (err) {\\n    console.log('Oh my!', err)\\n  })\\n  .on('close', function () {\\n    console.log('Stream closed')\\n  })\\n  .on('end', function () {\\n    console.log('Stream closed')\\n  })\\n```\\n\\nThe standard `pause()`, `resume()` and `destroy()` methods are implemented on the ReadStream, as is `pipe()` (see below). `'data'`, '`error'`, `'end'` and `'close'` events are emitted.\\n\\nAdditionally, you can supply an options object as the first parameter to `createReadStream()` with the following options:\\n\\n* `'gt'` (greater than), `'gte'` (greater than or equal) define the lower bound of the range to be streamed. Only records where the key is greater than (or equal to) this option will be included in the range. When `reverse=true` the order will be reversed, but the records streamed will be the same.\\n\\n* `'lt'` (less than), `'lte'` (less than or equal) define the higher bound of the range to be streamed. Only key/value pairs where the key is less than (or equal to) this option will be included in the range. When `reverse=true` the order will be reversed, but the records streamed will be the same.\\n\\n* `'start', 'end'` legacy ranges - instead use `'gte', 'lte'`\\n\\n* `'reverse'` *(boolean, default: `false`)*: a boolean, set true and the stream output will be reversed. Beware that due to the way LevelDB works, a reverse seek will be slower than a forward seek.\\n\\n* `'keys'` *(boolean, default: `true`)*: whether the `'data'` event should contain keys. If set to `true` and `'values'` set to `false` then `'data'` events will simply be keys, rather than objects with a `'key'` property. Used internally by the `createKeyStream()` method.\\n\\n* `'values'` *(boolean, default: `true`)*: whether the `'data'` event should contain values. If set to `true` and `'keys'` set to `false` then `'data'` events will simply be values, rather than objects with a `'value'` property. Used internally by the `createValueStream()` method.\\n\\n* `'limit'` *(number, default: `-1`)*: limit the number of results collected by this stream. This number represents a *maximum* number of results and may not be reached if you get to the end of the data first. A value of `-1` means there is no limit. When `reverse=true` the highest keys will be returned instead of the lowest keys.\\n\\n* `'fillCache'` *(boolean, default: `false`)*: whether LevelDB's LRU-cache should be filled with data read.\\n\\n* `'keyEncoding'` / `'valueEncoding'` *(string)*: the encoding applied to each read piece of data.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------\\n<a name=\\\"createKeyStream\\\"></a>\\n### db.createKeyStream([options])\\n\\nA **KeyStream** is a **ReadStream** where the `'data'` events are simply the keys from the database so it can be used like a traditional stream rather than an object stream.\\n\\nYou can obtain a KeyStream either by calling the `createKeyStream()` method on a LevelUP object or by passing an options object to `createReadStream()` with `keys` set to `true` and `values` set to `false`.\\n\\n```js\\ndb.createKeyStream()\\n  .on('data', function (data) {\\n    console.log('key=', data)\\n  })\\n\\n// same as:\\ndb.createReadStream({ keys: true, values: false })\\n  .on('data', function (data) {\\n    console.log('key=', data)\\n  })\\n```\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------\\n<a name=\\\"createValueStream\\\"></a>\\n### db.createValueStream([options])\\n\\nA **ValueStream** is a **ReadStream** where the `'data'` events are simply the values from the database so it can be used like a traditional stream rather than an object stream.\\n\\nYou can obtain a ValueStream either by calling the `createValueStream()` method on a LevelUP object or by passing an options object to `createReadStream()` with `values` set to `true` and `keys` set to `false`.\\n\\n```js\\ndb.createValueStream()\\n  .on('data', function (data) {\\n    console.log('value=', data)\\n  })\\n\\n// same as:\\ndb.createReadStream({ keys: false, values: true })\\n  .on('data', function (data) {\\n    console.log('value=', data)\\n  })\\n```\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------\\n<a name=\\\"writeStreams\\\"></a>\\n#### What happened to `db.createWriteStream`?\\n\\n`db.createWriteStream()` has been removed in order to provide a smaller and more maintainable core. It primarily existed to create symmetry with `db.createReadStream()` but through much [discussion](https://github.com/level/levelup/issues/199), removing it was the best cause of action.\\n\\nThe main driver for this was performance. While `db.createReadStream()` performs well under most use cases, `db.createWriteStream()` was highly dependent on the application keys and values. Thus we can't provide a standard implementation and encourage more `write-stream` implementations to be created to solve the broad spectrum of use cases.\\n\\nCheck out the implementations that the community has already produced [here](https://github.com/level/levelup/wiki/Modules#write-streams).\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------\\n<a name='approximateSize'></a>\\n### db.db.approximateSize(start, end, callback)\\n<code>approximateSize()</code> can used to get the approximate number of bytes of file system space used by the range `[start..end)`. The result may not include recently written data.\\n\\n```js\\nvar db = require('level')('./huge.db')\\n\\ndb.db.approximateSize('a', 'c', function (err, size) {\\n  if (err) return console.error('Ooops!', err)\\n  console.log('Approximate size of range is %d', size)\\n})\\n```\\n\\n**Note:** `approximateSize()` is available via [LevelDOWN](https://github.com/level/leveldown/), which by default is accessible as the `db` property of your LevelUP instance. This is a specific LevelDB operation and is not likely to be available where you replace LevelDOWN with an alternative back-end via the `'db'` option.\\n\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------\\n<a name='getProperty'></a>\\n### db.db.getProperty(property)\\n<code>getProperty</code> can be used to get internal details from LevelDB. When issued with a valid property string, a readable string will be returned (this method is synchronous).\\n\\nCurrently, the only valid properties are:\\n\\n* <b><code>'leveldb.num-files-at-levelN'</code></b>: returns the number of files at level *N*, where N is an integer representing a valid level (e.g. \\\"0\\\").\\n\\n* <b><code>'leveldb.stats'</code></b>: returns a multi-line string describing statistics about LevelDB's internal operation.\\n\\n* <b><code>'leveldb.sstables'</code></b>: returns a multi-line string describing all of the *sstables* that make up contents of the current database.\\n\\n\\n```js\\nvar db = require('level')('./huge.db')\\nconsole.log(db.db.getProperty('leveldb.num-files-at-level3'))\\n// → '243'\\n```\\n\\n**Note:** `getProperty()` is available via [LevelDOWN](https://github.com/level/leveldown/), which by default is accessible as the `db` property of your LevelUP instance. This is a specific LevelDB operation and is not likely to be available where you replace LevelDOWN with an alternative back-end via the `'db'` option.\\n\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------\\n<a name=\\\"destroy\\\"></a>\\n### leveldown.destroy(location, callback)\\n<code>destroy()</code> is used to completely remove an existing LevelDB database directory. You can use this function in place of a full directory *rm* if you want to be sure to only remove LevelDB-related files. If the directory only contains LevelDB files, the directory itself will be removed as well. If there are additional, non-LevelDB files in the directory, those files, and the directory, will be left alone.\\n\\nThe callback will be called when the destroy operation is complete, with a possible `error` argument.\\n\\n**Note:** `destroy()` is available via [LevelDOWN](https://github.com/level/leveldown/) which you will have to install seperately, e.g.:\\n\\n```js\\nrequire('leveldown').destroy('./huge.db', function (err) { console.log('done!') })\\n```\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------\\n<a name=\\\"repair\\\"></a>\\n### leveldown.repair(location, callback)\\n<code>repair()</code> can be used to attempt a restoration of a damaged LevelDB store. From the LevelDB documentation:\\n\\n> If a DB cannot be opened, you may attempt to call this method to resurrect as much of the contents of the database as possible. Some data may be lost, so be careful when calling this function on a database that contains important information.\\n\\nYou will find information on the *repair* operation in the *LOG* file inside the store directory.\\n\\nA `repair()` can also be used to perform a compaction of the LevelDB log into table files.\\n\\nThe callback will be called when the repair operation is complete, with a possible `error` argument.\\n\\n**Note:** `repair()` is available via [LevelDOWN](https://github.com/level/leveldown/) which you will have to install seperately, e.g.:\\n\\n```js\\nrequire('leveldown').repair('./huge.db', function (err) { console.log('done!') })\\n```\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n<a name=\\\"events\\\"></a>\\nEvents\\n------\\n\\nLevelUP emits events when the callbacks to the corresponding methods are called.\\n\\n* `db.emit('put', key, value)` emitted when a new value is `'put'`\\n* `db.emit('del', key)` emitted when a value is deleted\\n* `db.emit('batch', ary)` emitted when a batch operation has executed\\n* `db.emit('ready')` emitted when the database has opened (`'open'` is synonym)\\n* `db.emit('closed')` emitted when the database has closed\\n* `db.emit('opening')` emitted when the database is opening\\n* `db.emit('closing')` emitted when the database is closing\\n\\nIf you do not pass a callback to an async function, and there is an error, LevelUP will `emit('error', err)` instead.\\n\\n<a name=\\\"json\\\"></a>\\nJSON data\\n---------\\n\\nYou specify `'json'` encoding for both keys and/or values, you can then supply JavaScript objects to LevelUP and receive them from all fetch operations, including ReadStreams. LevelUP will automatically *stringify* your objects and store them as *utf8* and parse the strings back into objects before passing them back to you.\\n\\n<a name=\\\"custom_encodings\\\"></a>\\nCustom encodings\\n----------------\\n\\nA custom encoding may be provided by passing in an object as an value for `keyEncoding` or `valueEncoding` (wherever accepted), it must have the following properties:\\n\\n```js\\n{\\n    encode : function (val) { ... }\\n  , decode : function (val) { ... }\\n  , buffer : boolean // encode returns a buffer and decode accepts a buffer\\n  , type   : String  // name of this encoding type.\\n}\\n```\\n\\n<a name=\\\"extending\\\"></a>\\nExtending LevelUP\\n-----------------\\n\\nA list of <a href=\\\"https://github.com/level/levelup/wiki/Modules\\\"><b>Node.js LevelDB modules and projects</b></a> can be found in the wiki.\\n\\nWhen attempting to extend the functionality of LevelUP, it is recommended that you consider using [level-hooks](https://github.com/dominictarr/level-hooks) and/or [level-sublevel](https://github.com/dominictarr/level-sublevel). **level-sublevel** is particularly helpful for keeping additional, extension-specific, data in a LevelDB store. It allows you to partition a LevelUP instance into multiple sub-instances that each correspond to discrete namespaced key ranges.\\n\\n<a name=\\\"multiproc\\\"></a>\\nMulti-process access\\n--------------------\\n\\nLevelDB is thread-safe but is **not** suitable for accessing with multiple processes. You should only ever have a LevelDB database open from a single Node.js process. Node.js clusters are made up of multiple processes so a LevelUP instance cannot be shared between them either.\\n\\nSee the <a href=\\\"https://github.com/level/levelup/wiki/Modules\\\"><b>wiki</b></a> for some LevelUP extensions, including [multilevel](https://github.com/juliangruber/multilevel), that may help if you require a single data store to be shared across processes.\\n\\n<a name=\\\"support\\\"></a>\\nGetting support\\n---------------\\n\\nThere are multiple ways you can find help in using LevelDB in Node.js:\\n\\n * **IRC:** you'll find an active group of LevelUP users in the **##leveldb** channel on Freenode, including most of the contributors to this project.\\n * **Mailing list:** there is an active [Node.js LevelDB](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/node-levelup) Google Group.\\n * **GitHub:** you're welcome to open an issue here on this GitHub repository if you have a question.\\n\\n<a name=\\\"contributing\\\"></a>\\nContributing\\n------------\\n\\nLevelUP is an **OPEN Open Source Project**. This means that:\\n\\n> Individuals making significant and valuable contributions are given commit-access to the project to contribute as they see fit. This project is more like an open wiki than a standard guarded open source project.\\n\\nSee the [contribution guide](https://github.com/Level/community/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) for more details.\\n\\n### Windows\\n\\nA large portion of the Windows support comes from code by [Krzysztof Kowalczyk](http://blog.kowalczyk.info/) [@kjk](https://twitter.com/kjk), see his Windows LevelDB port [here](http://code.google.com/r/kkowalczyk-leveldb/).

Sometimes it's called a \"filter\",\n// but that's not a great name for it, since that implies a thing where\n// some bits pass through, and others are simply ignored.  (That would\n// be a valid example of a transform, of course.)\n//\n// While the output is causally related to the input, it's not a\n// necessarily symmetric or synchronous transformation.  For example,\n// a zlib stream might take multiple plain-text writes(), and then\n// emit a single compressed chunk some time in the future.\n//\n// Here's how this works:\n//\n// The Transform stream has all the aspects of the readable and writable\n// stream classes.  When you write(chunk), that calls _write(chunk,cb)\n// internally, and returns false if there's a lot of pending writes\n// buffered up.  When you call read(), that calls _read(n) until\n// there's enough pending readable data buffered up.\n//\n// In a transform stream, the written data is placed in a buffer.  When\n// _read(n) is called, it transforms the queued up data, calling the\n// buffered _write cb's as it consumes chunks.  If consuming a single\n// written chunk would result in multiple output chunks, then the first\n// outputted bit calls the readcb, and subsequent chunks just go into\n// the read buffer, and will cause it to emit 'readable' if necessary.\n//\n// This way, back-pressure is actually determined by the reading side,\n// since _read has to be called to start processing a new chunk.  However,\n// a pathological inflate type of transform can cause excessive buffering\n// here.  For example, imagine a stream where every byte of input is\n// interpreted as an integer from 0-255, and then results in that many\n// bytes of output.  Writing the 4 bytes {ff,ff,ff,ff} would result in\n// 1kb of data being output.  In this case, you could write a very small\n// amount of input, and end up with a very large amount of output.  In\n// such a pathological inflating mechanism, there'd be no way to tell\n// the system to stop doing the transform.

Sometimes it's called a \"filter\",\n// but that's not a great name for it, since that implies a thing where\n// some bits pass through, and others are simply ignored.  (That would\n// be a valid example of a transform, of course.)\n//\n// While the output is causally related to the input, it's not a\n// necessarily symmetric or synchronous transformation.  For example,\n// a zlib stream might take multiple plain-text writes(), and then\n// emit a single compressed chunk some time in the future.\n//\n// Here's how this works:\n//\n// The Transform stream has all the aspects of the readable and writable\n// stream classes.  When you write(chunk), that calls _write(chunk,cb)\n// internally, and returns false if there's a lot of pending writes\n// buffered up.  When you call read(), that calls _read(n) until\n// there's enough pending readable data buffered up.\n//\n// In a transform stream, the written data is placed in a buffer.  When\n// _read(n) is called, it transforms the queued up data, calling the\n// buffered _write cb's as it consumes chunks.  If consuming a single\n// written chunk would result in multiple output chunks, then the first\n// outputted bit calls the readcb, and subsequent chunks just go into\n// the read buffer, and will cause it to emit 'readable' if necessary.\n//\n// This way, back-pressure is actually determined by the reading side,\n// since _read has to be called to start processing a new chunk.  However,\n// a pathological inflate type of transform can cause excessive buffering\n// here.  For example, imagine a stream where every byte of input is\n// interpreted as an integer from 0-255, and then results in that many\n// bytes of output.  Writing the 4 bytes {ff,ff,ff,ff} would result in\n// 1kb of data being output.  In this case, you could write a very small\n// amount of input, and end up with a very large amount of output.  In\n// such a pathological inflating mechanism, there'd be no way to tell\n// the system to stop doing the transform.  A single 4MB write could\n// cause the system to run out of memory.\n//\n// However, even in such a pathological case, only a single written chunk\n// would be consumed, and then the rest would wait (un-transformed) until\n// the results of the previous transformed chunk were consumed.\n\n'use strict';\n\nmodule.exports = Transform;\n\nvar Duplex = require('./_stream_duplex');\n\n/*<replacement>*/\nvar util = require('core-util-is');\nutil.inherits = require('inherits');\n/*</replacement>*/\n\nutil.inherits(Transform, Duplex);\n\nfunction TransformState(stream) {\n  this.afterTransform = function (er, data) {\n    return afterTransform(stream, er, data);\n  };\n\n  this.needTransform = false;\n  this.transforming = false;\n  this.writecb = null;\n  this.writechunk = null;\n  this.writeencoding = null;\n}\n\nfunction afterTransform(stream, er, data) {\n  var ts = stream._transformState;\n  ts.transforming = false;\n\n  var cb = ts.writecb;\n\n  if (!cb) return stream.emit('error', new Error('no writecb in Transform class'));\n\n  ts.writechunk = null;\n  ts.writecb = null;\n\n  if (data !== null && data !== undefined) stream.push(data);\n\n  cb(er);\n\n  var rs = stream._readableState;\n  rs.reading = false;\n  if (rs.needReadable || rs.length < rs.highWaterMark) {\n    stream._read(rs.highWaterMark);\n  }\n}\n\nfunction Transform(options) {\n  if (!(this instanceof Transform)) return new Transform(options);\n\n  Duplex.call(this, options);\n\n  this._transformState = new TransformState(this);\n\n  // when the writable side finishes, then flush out anything remaining.\n  var stream = this;\n\n  // start out asking for a readable event once data is transformed.\n  this._readableState.needReadable = true;\n\n  // we have implemented the _read method, and done the other things\n  // that Readable wants before the first _read call, so unset the\n  // sync guard flag.\n  this._readableState.sync = false;\n\n  if (options) {\n    if (typeof options.transform === 'function') this._transform = options.transform;\n\n    if (typeof options.flush === 'function') this._flush = options.flush;\n  }\n\n  this.once('prefinish', function () {\n    if (typeof this._flush === 'function') this._flush(function (er) {\n      done(stream, er);\n    });else done(stream);\n  });\n}\n\nTransform.prototype.push = function (chunk, encoding) {\n  this._transformState.needTransform = false;\n  return Duplex.prototype.push.call(this, chunk, encoding);\n};\n\n// This is the part where you do stuff!\n// override this function in implementation classes.\n// 'chunk' is an input chunk.\n//\n// Call `push(newChunk)` to pass along transformed output\n// to the readable side.

copyright</a>\\n\\n<a name=\\\"intro\\\"></a>\\nIntroduction\\n------------\\n\\n**[LevelDB](https://github.com/google/leveldb)** is a simple key/value data store built by Google, inspired by BigTable. It's used in Google Chrome and many other products. LevelDB supports arbitrary byte arrays as both keys and values, singular *get*, *put* and *delete* operations, *batched put and delete*, bi-directional iterators and simple compression using the very fast [Snappy](http://google.github.io/snappy/) algorithm.\\n\\n**LevelUP** aims to expose the features of LevelDB in a **Node.js-friendly way**. All standard `Buffer` encoding types are supported, as is a special JSON encoding. LevelDB's iterators are exposed as a Node.js-style **readable stream**.\\n\\nLevelDB stores entries **sorted lexicographically by keys**. This makes LevelUP's <a href=\\\"#createReadStream\\\"><code>ReadStream</code></a> interface a very powerful query mechanism.\\n\\n**LevelUP** is an **OPEN Open Source Project**, see the <a href=\\\"#contributing\\\">Contributing</a> section to find out what this means.\\n\\n<a name=\\\"leveldown\\\"></a>\\nRelationship to LevelDOWN\\n-------------------------\\n\\nLevelUP is designed to be backed by **[LevelDOWN](https://github.com/level/leveldown/)** which provides a pure C++ binding to LevelDB and can be used as a stand-alone package if required.\\n\\n**As of version 0.9, LevelUP no longer requires LevelDOWN as a dependency so you must `npm install leveldown` when you install LevelUP.**\\n\\nLevelDOWN is now optional because LevelUP can be used with alternative backends, such as **[level.js](https://github.com/maxogden/level.js)** in the browser or [MemDOWN](https://github.com/level/memdown) for a pure in-memory store.\\n\\nLevelUP will look for LevelDOWN and throw an error if it can't find it in its Node `require()` path. It will also tell you if the installed version of LevelDOWN is incompatible.\\n\\n**The [level](https://github.com/level/level) package is available as an alternative installation mechanism.** Install it instead to automatically get both LevelUP & LevelDOWN. It exposes LevelUP on its export (i.e. you can `var leveldb = require('level')`).\\n\\n\\n<a name=\\\"platforms\\\"></a>\\nTested & supported platforms\\n----------------------------\\n\\n  * **Linux**: including ARM platforms such as Raspberry Pi *and Kindle!*\\n  * **Mac OS**\\n  * **Solaris**: including Joyent's SmartOS & Nodejitsu\\n  * **Windows**: Node 0.10 and above only. See installation instructions for *node-gyp's* dependencies [here](https://github.com/TooTallNate/node-gyp#installation), you'll need these (free) components from Microsoft to compile and run any native Node add-on in Windows.\\n\\n<a name=\\\"basic\\\"></a>\\nBasic usage\\n-----------\\n\\nFirst you need to install LevelUP!\\n\\n```sh\\n$ npm install levelup leveldown\\n```\\n\\nOr\\n\\n```sh\\n$ npm install level\\n```\\n\\n*(this second option requires you to use LevelUP by calling `var levelup = require('level')`)*\\n\\n\\nAll operations are asynchronous although they don't necessarily require a callback if you don't need to know when the operation was performed.\\n\\n```js\\nvar levelup = require('levelup')\\n\\n// 1) Create our database, supply location and options.\\n//    This will create or open the underlying LevelDB store.\\nvar db = levelup('./mydb')\\n\\n// 2) put a key & value\\ndb.put('name', 'LevelUP', function (err) {\\n  if (err) return console.log('Ooops!', err) // some kind of I/O error\\n\\n  // 3) fetch by key\\n  db.get('name', function (err, value) {\\n    if (err) return console.log('Ooops!', err) // likely the key was not found\\n\\n    // ta da!\\n    console.log('name=' + value)\\n  })\\n})\\n```\\n\\n<a name=\\\"api\\\"></a>\\n## API\\n\\n  * <a href=\\\"#ctor\\\"><code><b>levelup()</b></code></a>\\n  * <a href=\\\"#open\\\"><code>db.<b>open()</b></code></a>\\n  * <a href=\\\"#close\\\"><code>db.<b>close()</b></code></a>\\n  * <a href=\\\"#put\\\"><code>db.<b>put()</b></code></a>\\n  * <a href=\\\"#get\\\"><code>db.<b>get()</b></code></a>\\n  * <a href=\\\"#del\\\"><code>db.<b>del()</b></code></a>\\n  * <a href=\\\"#batch\\\"><code>db.<b>batch()</b></code> *(array form)*</a>\\n  * <a href=\\\"#batch_chained\\\"><code>db.<b>batch()</b></code> *(chained form)*</a>\\n  * <a href=\\\"#isOpen\\\"><code>db.<b>isOpen()</b></code></a>\\n  * <a href=\\\"#isClosed\\\"><code>db.<b>isClosed()</b></code></a>\\n  * <a href=\\\"#createReadStream\\\"><code>db.<b>createReadStream()</b></code></a>\\n  * <a href=\\\"#createKeyStream\\\"><code>db.<b>createKeyStream()</b></code></a>\\n  * <a href=\\\"#createValueStream\\\"><code>db.<b>createValueStream()</b></code></a>\\n\\n### Special operations exposed by LevelDOWN\\n\\n  * <a href=\\\"#approximateSize\\\"><code>db.db.<b>approximateSize()</b></code></a>\\n  * <a href=\\\"#getProperty\\\"><code>db.db.<b>getProperty()</b></code></a>\\n  * <a href=\\\"#destroy\\\"><code><b>leveldown.destroy()</b></code></a>\\n  * <a href=\\\"#repair\\\"><code><b>leveldown.repair()</b></code></a>\\n\\n### Special Notes\\n  * <a href=\\\"#writeStreams\\\">What happened to <code><b>db.createWriteStream()</b></code></a>\\n\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------\\n<a name=\\\"ctor\\\"></a>\\n### levelup(location[, options[, callback]])\\n### levelup(options[, callback ])\\n### levelup(db[, callback ])\\n<code>levelup()</code> is the main entry point for creating a new LevelUP instance and opening the underlying store with LevelDB.\\n\\nThis function returns a new instance of LevelUP and will also initiate an <a href=\\\"#open\\\"><code>open()</code></a> operation. Opening the database is an asynchronous operation which will trigger your callback if you provide one. The callback should take the form: `function (err, db) {}` where the `db` is the LevelUP instance. If you don't provide a callback, any read & write operations are simply queued internally until the database is fully opened.\\n\\nThis leads to two alternative ways of managing a new LevelUP instance:\\n\\n```js\\nlevelup(location, options, function (err, db) {\\n  if (err) throw err\\n  db.get('foo', function (err, value) {\\n    if (err) return console.log('foo does not exist')\\n    console.log('got foo =', value)\\n  })\\n})\\n\\n// vs the equivalent:\\n\\nvar db = levelup(location, options) // will throw if an error occurs\\ndb.get('foo', function (err, value) {\\n  if (err) return console.log('foo does not exist')\\n  console.log('got foo =', value)\\n})\\n```\\n\\nThe `location` argument is available as a read-only property on the returned LevelUP instance.\\n\\nThe `levelup(options, callback)` form (with optional `callback`) is only available where you provide a valid `'db'` property on the options object (see below). Only for back-ends that don't require a `location` argument, such as [MemDOWN](https://github.com/level/memdown).\\n\\nFor example:\\n\\n```js\\nvar levelup = require('levelup')\\nvar memdown = require('memdown')\\nvar db = levelup({ db: memdown })\\n```\\n\\nThe `levelup(db, callback)` form (with optional `callback`) is only available where `db` is a factory function, as would be provided as a `'db'` property on an `options` object (see below). Only for back-ends that don't require a `location` argument, such as [MemDOWN](https://github.com/level/memdown).\\n\\nFor example:\\n\\n```js\\nvar levelup = require('levelup')\\nvar memdown = require('memdown')\\nvar db = levelup(memdown)\\n```\\n\\n#### `options`\\n\\n`levelup()` takes an optional options object as its second argument; the following properties are accepted:\\n\\n* `'createIfMissing'` *(boolean, default: `true`)*: If `true`, will initialise an empty database at the specified location if one doesn't already exist. If `false` and a database doesn't exist you will receive an error in your `open()` callback and your database won't open.\\n\\n* `'errorIfExists'` *(boolean, default: `false`)*: If `true`, you will receive an error in your `open()` callback if the database exists at the specified location.\\n\\n* `'compression'` *(boolean, default: `true`)*: If `true`, all *compressible* data will be run through the Snappy compression algorithm before being stored. Snappy is very fast and shouldn't gain much speed by disabling so leave this on unless you have good reason to turn it off.\\n\\n* `'cacheSize'` *(number, default: `8 * 1024 * 1024`)*: The size (in bytes) of the in-memory [LRU](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cache_algorithms#Least_Recently_Used) cache with frequently used uncompressed block contents.\\n\\n* `'keyEncoding'` and `'valueEncoding'` *(string, default: `'utf8'`)*: The encoding of the keys and values passed through Node.js' `Buffer` implementation (see [Buffer#toString()](http://nodejs.org/docs/latest/api/buffer.html#buffer_buf_tostring_encoding_start_end)).\\n  <p><code>'utf8'</code> is the default encoding for both keys and values so you can simply pass in strings and expect strings from your <code>get()</code> operations. You can also pass <code>Buffer</code> objects as keys and/or values and conversion will be performed.</p>\\n  <p>Supported encodings are: hex, utf8, ascii, binary, base64, ucs2, utf16le.</p>\\n  <p><code>'json'</code> encoding is also supported, see below.</p>\\n\\n* `'db'` *(object, default: LevelDOWN)*: LevelUP is backed by [LevelDOWN](https://github.com/level/leveldown/) to provide an interface to LevelDB. You can completely replace the use of LevelDOWN by providing a \\\"factory\\\" function that will return a LevelDOWN API compatible object given a `location` argument. For further information, see [MemDOWN](https://github.com/level/memdown), a fully LevelDOWN API compatible replacement that uses a memory store rather than LevelDB. Also see [Abstract LevelDOWN](http://github.com/level/abstract-leveldown), a partial implementation of the LevelDOWN API that can be used as a base prototype for a LevelDOWN substitute.\\n\\nAdditionally, each of the main interface methods accept an optional options object that can be used to override `'keyEncoding'` and `'valueEncoding'`.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------\\n<a name=\\\"open\\\"></a>\\n### db.open([callback])\\n<code>open()</code> opens the underlying LevelDB store. In general **you should never need to call this method directly** as it's automatically called by <a href=\\\"#ctor\\\"><code>levelup()</code></a>.\\n\\nHowever, it is possible to *reopen* a database after it has been closed with <a href=\\\"#close\\\"><code>close()</code></a>, although this is not generally advised.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------\\n<a name=\\\"close\\\"></a>\\n### db.close([callback])\\n<code>close()</code> closes the underlying LevelDB store. The callback will receive any error encountered during closing as the first argument.\\n\\nYou should always clean up your LevelUP instance by calling `close()` when you no longer need it to free up resources. A LevelDB store cannot be opened by multiple instances of LevelDB/LevelUP simultaneously.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------\\n<a name=\\\"put\\\"></a>\\n### db.put(key, value[, options][, callback])\\n<code>put()</code> is the primary method for inserting data into the store. Both the `key` and `value` can be arbitrary data objects.\\n\\nThe callback argument is optional but if you don't provide one and an error occurs then expect the error to be thrown.\\n\\n#### `options`\\n\\nEncoding of the `key` and `value` objects will adhere to `'keyEncoding'` and `'valueEncoding'` options provided to <a href=\\\"#ctor\\\"><code>levelup()</code></a>, although you can provide alternative encoding settings in the options for `put()` (it's recommended that you stay consistent in your encoding of keys and values in a single store).\\n\\nIf you provide a `'sync'` value of `true` in your `options` object, LevelDB will perform a synchronous write of the data; although the operation will be asynchronous as far as Node is concerned. Normally, LevelDB passes the data to the operating system for writing and returns immediately, however a synchronous write will use `fsync()` or equivalent so your callback won't be triggered until the data is actually on disk. Synchronous filesystem writes are **significantly** slower than asynchronous writes but if you want to be absolutely sure that the data is flushed then you can use `'sync': true`.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------\\n<a name=\\\"get\\\"></a>\\n### db.get(key[, options][, callback])\\n<code>get()</code> is the primary method for fetching data from the store. The `key` can be an arbitrary data object. If it doesn't exist in the store then the callback will receive an error as its first argument. A not-found err object will be of type `'NotFoundError'` so you can `err.type == 'NotFoundError'` or you can perform a truthy test on the property `err.notFound`.\\n\\n```js\\ndb.get('foo', function (err, value) {\\n  if (err) {\\n    if (err.notFound) {\\n      // handle a 'NotFoundError' here\\n      return\\n    }\\n    // I/O or other error, pass it up the callback chain\\n    return callback(err)\\n  }\\n\\n  // .. handle `value` here\\n})\\n```\\n\\n#### `options`\\n\\nEncoding of the `key` and `value` objects is the same as in <a href=\\\"#put\\\"><code>put</code></a>. \\n\\nLevelDB will by default fill the in-memory LRU Cache with data from a call to get. Disabling this is done by setting `fillCache` to `false`.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------\\n<a name=\\\"del\\\"></a>\\n### db.del(key[, options][, callback])\\n<code>del()</code> is the primary method for removing data from the store.\\n```js\\ndb.del('foo', function (err) {\\n  if (err)\\n    // handle I/O or other error\\n});\\n```\\n\\n#### `options`\\n\\nEncoding of the `key` object will adhere to the `'keyEncoding'` option provided to <a href=\\\"#ctor\\\"><code>levelup()</code></a>, although you can provide alternative encoding settings in the options for `del()` (it's recommended that you stay consistent in your encoding of keys and values in a single store).\\n\\nA `'sync'` option can also be passed, see <a href=\\\"#put\\\"><code>put()</code></a> for details on how this works.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------\\n<a name=\\\"batch\\\"></a>\\n### db.batch(array[, options][, callback]) *(array form)*\\n<code>batch()</code> can be used for very fast bulk-write operations (both *put* and *delete*). The `array` argument should contain a list of operations to be executed sequentially, although as a whole they are performed as an atomic operation inside LevelDB.\\n\\nEach operation is contained in an object having the following properties: `type`, `key`, `value`, where the *type* is either `'put'` or `'del'`. In the case of `'del'` the `'value'` property is ignored. Any entries with a `'key'` of `null` or `undefined` will cause an error to be returned on the `callback` and any `'type': 'put'` entry with a `'value'` of `null` or `undefined` will return an error.\\n\\nIf `key` and `value` are defined but `type` is not, it will default to `'put'`.\\n\\n```js\\nvar ops = [\\n    { type: 'del', key: 'father' }\\n  , { type: 'put', key: 'name', value: 'Yuri Irsenovich Kim' }\\n  , { type: 'put', key: 'dob', value: '16 February 1941' }\\n  , { type: 'put', key: 'spouse', value: 'Kim Young-sook' }\\n  , { type: 'put', key: 'occupation', value: 'Clown' }\\n]\\n\\ndb.batch(ops, function (err) {\\n  if (err) return console.log('Ooops!', err)\\n  console.log('Great success dear leader!')\\n})\\n```\\n\\n#### `options`\\n\\nSee <a href=\\\"#put\\\"><code>put()</code></a> for a discussion on the `options` object. You can overwrite default `'keyEncoding'` and `'valueEncoding'` and also specify the use of `sync` filesystem operations.\\n\\nIn addition to encoding options for the whole batch you can also overwrite the encoding per operation, like:\\n\\n```js\\nvar ops = [{\\n    type          : 'put'\\n  , key           : new Buffer([1, 2, 3])\\n  , value         : { some: 'json' }\\n  , keyEncoding   : 'binary'\\n  , valueEncoding : 'json'\\n}]\\n```\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------\\n<a name=\\\"batch_chained\\\"></a>\\n### db.batch() *(chained form)*\\n<code>batch()</code>, when called with no arguments will return a `Batch` object which can be used to build, and eventually commit, an atomic LevelDB batch operation. Depending on how it's used, it is possible to obtain greater performance when using the chained form of `batch()` over the array form.\\n\\n```js\\ndb.batch()\\n  .del('father')\\n  .put('name', 'Yuri Irsenovich Kim')\\n  .put('dob', '16 February 1941')\\n  .put('spouse', 'Kim Young-sook')\\n  .put('occupation', 'Clown')\\n  .write(function () { console.log('Done!') })\\n```\\n\\n<b><code>batch.put(key, value[, options])</code></b>\\n\\nQueue a *put* operation on the current batch, not committed until a `write()` is called on the batch.\\n\\nThe optional `options` argument can be used to override the default `'keyEncoding'` and/or `'valueEncoding'`.\\n\\nThis method may `throw` a `WriteError` if there is a problem with your put (such as the `value` being `null` or `undefined`).\\n\\n<b><code>batch.del(key[, options])</code></b>\\n\\nQueue a *del* operation on the current batch, not committed until a `write()` is called on the batch.\\n\\nThe optional `options` argument can be used to override the default `'keyEncoding'`.\\n\\nThis method may `throw` a `WriteError` if there is a problem with your delete.\\n\\n<b><code>batch.clear()</code></b>\\n\\nClear all queued operations on the current batch, any previous operations will be discarded.\\n\\n<b><code>batch.length</code></b>\\n\\nThe number of queued operations on the current batch.\\n\\n<b><code>batch.write([callback])</code></b>\\n\\nCommit the queued operations for this batch. All operations not *cleared* will be written to the database atomically, that is, they will either all succeed or fail with no partial commits. The optional `callback` will be called when the operation has completed with an *error* argument if an error has occurred; if no `callback` is supplied and an error occurs then this method will `throw` a `WriteError`.\\n\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------\\n<a name=\\\"isOpen\\\"></a>\\n### db.isOpen()\\n\\nA LevelUP object can be in one of the following states:\\n\\n  * *\\\"new\\\"*     - newly created, not opened or closed\\n  * *\\\"opening\\\"* - waiting for the database to be opened\\n  * *\\\"open\\\"*    - successfully opened the database, available for use\\n  * *\\\"closing\\\"* - waiting for the database to be closed\\n  * *\\\"closed\\\"*  - database has been successfully closed, should not be used\\n\\n`isOpen()` will return `true` only when the state is \\\"open\\\".\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------\\n<a name=\\\"isClosed\\\"></a>\\n### db.isClosed()\\n\\n*See <a href=\\\"#put\\\"><code>isOpen()</code></a>*\\n\\n`isClosed()` will return `true` only when the state is \\\"closing\\\" *or* \\\"closed\\\", it can be useful for determining if read and write operations are permissible.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------\\n<a name=\\\"createReadStream\\\"></a>\\n### db.createReadStream([options])\\n\\nYou can obtain a **ReadStream** of the full database by calling the `createReadStream()` method. The resulting stream is a complete Node.js-style [Readable Stream](http://nodejs.org/docs/latest/api/stream.html#stream_readable_stream) where `'data'` events emit objects with `'key'` and `'value'` pairs. You can also use the `gt`, `lt` and `limit` options to control the range of keys that are streamed.\\n\\n```js\\ndb.createReadStream()\\n  .on('data', function (data) {\\n    console.log(data.key, '=', data.value)\\n  })\\n  .on('error', function (err) {\\n    console.log('Oh my!', err)\\n  })\\n  .on('close', function () {\\n    console.log('Stream closed')\\n  })\\n  .on('end', function () {\\n    console.log('Stream closed')\\n  })\\n```\\n\\nThe standard `pause()`, `resume()` and `destroy()` methods are implemented on the ReadStream, as is `pipe()` (see below). `'data'`, '`error'`, `'end'` and `'close'` events are emitted.\\n\\nAdditionally, you can supply an options object as the first parameter to `createReadStream()` with the following options:\\n\\n* `'gt'` (greater than), `'gte'` (greater than or equal) define the lower bound of the range to be streamed. Only records where the key is greater than (or equal to) this option will be included in the range. When `reverse=true` the order will be reversed, but the records streamed will be the same.\\n\\n* `'lt'` (less than), `'lte'` (less than or equal) define the higher bound of the range to be streamed. Only key/value pairs where the key is less than (or equal to) this option will be included in the range. When `reverse=true` the order will be reversed, but the records streamed will be the same.\\n\\n* `'start', 'end'` legacy ranges - instead use `'gte', 'lte'`\\n\\n* `'reverse'` *(boolean, default: `false`)*: a boolean, set true and the stream output will be reversed. Beware that due to the way LevelDB works, a reverse seek will be slower than a forward seek.\\n\\n* `'keys'` *(boolean, default: `true`)*: whether the `'data'` event should contain keys. If set to `true` and `'values'` set to `false` then `'data'` events will simply be keys, rather than objects with a `'key'` property. Used internally by the `createKeyStream()` method.\\n\\n* `'values'` *(boolean, default: `true`)*: whether the `'data'` event should contain values. If set to `true` and `'keys'` set to `false` then `'data'` events will simply be values, rather than objects with a `'value'` property. Used internally by the `createValueStream()` method.\\n\\n* `'limit'` *(number, default: `-1`)*: limit the number of results collected by this stream. This number represents a *maximum* number of results and may not be reached if you get to the end of the data first. A value of `-1` means there is no limit. When `reverse=true` the highest keys will be returned instead of the lowest keys.\\n\\n* `'fillCache'` *(boolean, default: `false`)*: whether LevelDB's LRU-cache should be filled with data read.\\n\\n* `'keyEncoding'` / `'valueEncoding'` *(string)*: the encoding applied to each read piece of data.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------\\n<a name=\\\"createKeyStream\\\"></a>\\n### db.createKeyStream([options])\\n\\nA **KeyStream** is a **ReadStream** where the `'data'` events are simply the keys from the database so it can be used like a traditional stream rather than an object stream.\\n\\nYou can obtain a KeyStream either by calling the `createKeyStream()` method on a LevelUP object or by passing an options object to `createReadStream()` with `keys` set to `true` and `values` set to `false`.\\n\\n```js\\ndb.createKeyStream()\\n  .on('data', function (data) {\\n    console.log('key=', data)\\n  })\\n\\n// same as:\\ndb.createReadStream({ keys: true, values: false })\\n  .on('data', function (data) {\\n    console.log('key=', data)\\n  })\\n```\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------\\n<a name=\\\"createValueStream\\\"></a>\\n### db.createValueStream([options])\\n\\nA **ValueStream** is a **ReadStream** where the `'data'` events are simply the values from the database so it can be used like a traditional stream rather than an object stream.\\n\\nYou can obtain a ValueStream either by calling the `createValueStream()` method on a LevelUP object or by passing an options object to `createReadStream()` with `values` set to `true` and `keys` set to `false`.\\n\\n```js\\ndb.createValueStream()\\n  .on('data', function (data) {\\n    console.log('value=', data)\\n  })\\n\\n// same as:\\ndb.createReadStream({ keys: false, values: true })\\n  .on('data', function (data) {\\n    console.log('value=', data)\\n  })\\n```\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------\\n<a name=\\\"writeStreams\\\"></a>\\n#### What happened to `db.createWriteStream`?\\n\\n`db.createWriteStream()` has been removed in order to provide a smaller and more maintainable core. It primarily existed to create symmetry with `db.createReadStream()` but through much [discussion](https://github.com/level/levelup/issues/199), removing it was the best cause of action.\\n\\nThe main driver for this was performance. While `db.createReadStream()` performs well under most use cases, `db.createWriteStream()` was highly dependent on the application keys and values. Thus we can't provide a standard implementation and encourage more `write-stream` implementations to be created to solve the broad spectrum of use cases.\\n\\nCheck out the implementations that the community has already produced [here](https://github.com/level/levelup/wiki/Modules#write-streams).\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------\\n<a name='approximateSize'></a>\\n### db.db.approximateSize(start, end, callback)\\n<code>approximateSize()</code> can used to get the approximate number of bytes of file system space used by the range `[start..end)`. The result may not include recently written data.\\n\\n```js\\nvar db = require('level')('./huge.db')\\n\\ndb.db.approximateSize('a', 'c', function (err, size) {\\n  if (err) return console.error('Ooops!', err)\\n  console.log('Approximate size of range is %d', size)\\n})\\n```\\n\\n**Note:** `approximateSize()` is available via [LevelDOWN](https://github.com/level/leveldown/), which by default is accessible as the `db` property of your LevelUP instance. This is a specific LevelDB operation and is not likely to be available where you replace LevelDOWN with an alternative back-end via the `'db'` option.\\n\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------\\n<a name='getProperty'></a>\\n### db.db.getProperty(property)\\n<code>getProperty</code> can be used to get internal details from LevelDB. When issued with a valid property string, a readable string will be returned (this method is synchronous).\\n\\nCurrently, the only valid properties are:\\n\\n* <b><code>'leveldb.num-files-at-levelN'</code></b>: returns the number of files at level *N*, where N is an integer representing a valid level (e.g. \\\"0\\\").\\n\\n* <b><code>'leveldb.stats'</code></b>: returns a multi-line string describing statistics about LevelDB's internal operation.\\n\\n* <b><code>'leveldb.sstables'</code></b>: returns a multi-line string describing all of the *sstables* that make up contents of the current database.\\n\\n\\n```js\\nvar db = require('level')('./huge.db')\\nconsole.log(db.db.getProperty('leveldb.num-files-at-level3'))\\n// → '243'\\n```\\n\\n**Note:** `getProperty()` is available via [LevelDOWN](https://github.com/level/leveldown/), which by default is accessible as the `db` property of your LevelUP instance. This is a specific LevelDB operation and is not likely to be available where you replace LevelDOWN with an alternative back-end via the `'db'` option.\\n\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------\\n<a name=\\\"destroy\\\"></a>\\n### leveldown.destroy(location, callback)\\n<code>destroy()</code> is used to completely remove an existing LevelDB database directory. You can use this function in place of a full directory *rm* if you want to be sure to only remove LevelDB-related files. If the directory only contains LevelDB files, the directory itself will be removed as well. If there are additional, non-LevelDB files in the directory, those files, and the directory, will be left alone.\\n\\nThe callback will be called when the destroy operation is complete, with a possible `error` argument.\\n\\n**Note:** `destroy()` is available via [LevelDOWN](https://github.com/level/leveldown/) which you will have to install seperately, e.g.:\\n\\n```js\\nrequire('leveldown').destroy('./huge.db', function (err) { console.log('done!') })\\n```\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------\\n<a name=\\\"repair\\\"></a>\\n### leveldown.repair(location, callback)\\n<code>repair()</code> can be used to attempt a restoration of a damaged LevelDB store. From the LevelDB documentation:\\n\\n> If a DB cannot be opened, you may attempt to call this method to resurrect as much of the contents of the database as possible. Some data may be lost, so be careful when calling this function on a database that contains important information.\\n\\nYou will find information on the *repair* operation in the *LOG* file inside the store directory.\\n\\nA `repair()` can also be used to perform a compaction of the LevelDB log into table files.\\n\\nThe callback will be called when the repair operation is complete, with a possible `error` argument.\\n\\n**Note:** `repair()` is available via [LevelDOWN](https://github.com/level/leveldown/) which you will have to install seperately, e.g.:\\n\\n```js\\nrequire('leveldown').repair('./huge.db', function (err) { console.log('done!') })\\n```\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n<a name=\\\"events\\\"></a>\\nEvents\\n------\\n\\nLevelUP emits events when the callbacks to the corresponding methods are called.\\n\\n* `db.emit('put', key, value)` emitted when a new value is `'put'`\\n* `db.emit('del', key)` emitted when a value is deleted\\n* `db.emit('batch', ary)` emitted when a batch operation has executed\\n* `db.emit('ready')` emitted when the database has opened (`'open'` is synonym)\\n* `db.emit('closed')` emitted when the database has closed\\n* `db.emit('opening')` emitted when the database is opening\\n* `db.emit('closing')` emitted when the database is closing\\n\\nIf you do not pass a callback to an async function, and there is an error, LevelUP will `emit('error', err)` instead.\\n\\n<a name=\\\"json\\\"></a>\\nJSON data\\n---------\\n\\nYou specify `'json'` encoding for both keys and/or values, you can then supply JavaScript objects to LevelUP and receive them from all fetch operations, including ReadStreams. LevelUP will automatically *stringify* your objects and store them as *utf8* and parse the strings back into objects before passing them back to you.\\n\\n<a name=\\\"custom_encodings\\\"></a>\\nCustom encodings\\n----------------\\n\\nA custom encoding may be provided by passing in an object as an value for `keyEncoding` or `valueEncoding` (wherever accepted), it must have the following properties:\\n\\n```js\\n{\\n    encode : function (val) { ... }\\n  , decode : function (val) { ... }\\n  , buffer : boolean // encode returns a buffer and decode accepts a buffer\\n  , type   : String  // name of this encoding type.\\n}\\n```\\n\\n<a name=\\\"extending\\\"></a>\\nExtending LevelUP\\n-----------------\\n\\nA list of <a href=\\\"https://github.com/level/levelup/wiki/Modules\\\"><b>Node.js LevelDB modules and projects</b></a> can be found in the wiki.\\n\\nWhen attempting to extend the functionality of LevelUP, it is recommended that you consider using [level-hooks](https://github.com/dominictarr/level-hooks) and/or [level-sublevel](https://github.com/dominictarr/level-sublevel). **level-sublevel** is particularly helpful for keeping additional, extension-specific, data in a LevelDB store. It allows you to partition a LevelUP instance into multiple sub-instances that each correspond to discrete namespaced key ranges.\\n\\n<a name=\\\"multiproc\\\"></a>\\nMulti-process access\\n--------------------\\n\\nLevelDB is thread-safe but is **not** suitable for accessing with multiple processes. You should only ever have a LevelDB database open from a single Node.js process. Node.js clusters are made up of multiple processes so a LevelUP instance cannot be shared between them either.\\n\\nSee the <a href=\\\"https://github.com/level/levelup/wiki/Modules\\\"><b>wiki</b></a> for some LevelUP extensions, including [multilevel](https://github.com/juliangruber/multilevel), that may help if you require a single data store to be shared across processes.\\n\\n<a name=\\\"support\\\"></a>\\nGetting support\\n---------------\\n\\nThere are multiple ways you can find help in using LevelDB in Node.js:\\n\\n * **IRC:** you'll find an active group of LevelUP users in the **##leveldb** channel on Freenode, including most of the contributors to this project.\\n * **Mailing list:** there is an active [Node.js LevelDB](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/node-levelup) Google Group.\\n * **GitHub:** you're welcome to open an issue here on this GitHub repository if you have a question.\\n\\n<a name=\\\"contributing\\\"></a>\\nContributing\\n------------\\n\\nLevelUP is an **OPEN Open Source Project**. This means that:\\n\\n> Individuals making significant and valuable contributions are given commit-access to the project to contribute as they see fit.
